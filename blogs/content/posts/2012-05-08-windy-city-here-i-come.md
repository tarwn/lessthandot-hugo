<span style="text-align: left;">Two years ago, I went to my very first SQL Saturday, #31, Chicago 2010. It was awesome. It introduced me to the SQL Community At Large, and I met people who would become my closest friends. I also watched, among others, Brent Ozar present on his sp_blitz script and heard Brad McGehee talk about execution plans. </span>

<span style="text-align: left;">Chicago is once again host to SQL Saturday, this time <a href="http://sqlsaturday.com/119/eventhome.aspx">#119</a>, on Saturday, May 19, 2012. I&#8217;ll be heading down to meet friends, learn more about SQL Server 2012 and virtualization, and present! </span>

<span style="text-align: left;">My first stop will be the <a href="http://sqlfriends.org/2012/03/sqlfriends-lunch-take-2/">SQL Friends lunch</a> at Buca di Beppo on Friday, May 18. The star of the show, who I may have a list of 20 questions for, is none other than fellow LTD blogger Ted Krueger. There are still spots available, so register today! </span>

<span style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll be presenting &#8220;Reporting Services: From Basic to WOW!&#8221; after lunch. I&#8217;ve given this session many times, including PASS Summit last year, and every time it is fun and both I and the attendees learn something! </span>
