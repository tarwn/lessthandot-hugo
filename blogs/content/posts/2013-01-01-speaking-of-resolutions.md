It's New Year's Day and I am finishing the last of my traditional holiday vacation. Tomorrow, I will return to my office after a hiatus of almost two weeks and am sure I will spend most of the day inundated by emails and following up on the projects that were in process when I left. But today, I was reading through recent blog posts by two of our more prolific writers here on LessThanDot, Onpnt (Ted Krueger) with [Blogging isn't easy unless you have support][1] and SQLDenis (Denis Gobo) with [Ah yes, those pesky resolutions][2]. I have to admit, both of them have inspired me with my own resolutions and blogging.

I went back and looked at my own blog posts over the time since we first began LessThanDot. In total, I have 11 that I have written, 4 of them written in 2012 (which is more than I originally thought I had done). I have at least one that is currently in process from this past August after a conversation with fellow LTD'er Chrissie1 but not sure if I remember enough of what I originally intended to write that I will be able to finish it. That being said, though, I love to write and, quite frankly, am rather disappointed with the efforts I have put forth in writing more on this site. My own personal blog is not much better. But, I am setting forth a goal to write 12 new blogposts this year on LessThanDot â€“ which would be 3 times my best year to this point. I do not think an average of one a month is unreasonable and it will hopefully prod me to produce better work than I have done to this point.

As Ted noted in his own post yesterday, the more we write, the better we become and, while I do consider myself to be fairly proficient when it comes to writing, I have also found that my skills have deteriorated from lack of use. Additionally, I know what I want to say but being able to do so succinctly, directly and ensuring that the reader interprets what I wrote as I intended for them to do so can be challenging and I hope to improve this. As a project manager, this is a very important skill as one of the major bugaboos of any project is miscommunication and misunderstandings.

Finally, while I do not typically set a great deal of resolutions, I will do so this year. In addition to more blog posts, I intend to do at least two formal training classes offered by my company to further my skills in project management. Frankly, there is still a great deal that I have not yet learned and I would like to be better so that I can handle whatever comes my way professionally.

So a Happy New Year to everyone!
