  In exactly one week I'll be giving a session with my colleague Valentino Vranken (<a href="http://blog.hoegaerden.be/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ValentinoV42">twitter</a>) at the <a href="http://www.communityday.be/">Belgian Community Day</a>. We'll be talking about Data Visualization. I'll be talking about the <em>tips</em>: how do you need to visualize your data without the audience scratching their eyes out because of the ugly colors you used? Why would or wouldn't you use pie charts? And what's the difference between an analytical dashboard and an operational dashboard? You can find answers on such question in this session.

  Valentino will be talking about the <em>tricks</em>: little bits of wisdom on how to get things done in Reporting Services. We did the dry-run of the session yesterday and I definitely learned something from his part, so be sure to check it out!

  The Community Day is on the 20<sup>th</sup> of June in the city of Mechelen. It combines the various user groups of Belgium (and some of the Netherlands) and gives you an astonishing 5 track agenda with over 30 sessions! So get yourself registered, come on over and get your learning cap on!
