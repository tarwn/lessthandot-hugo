Now here is some exciting news if you are a web developer in a MSFT shop. Microsoft will ship jQuery with ASP.NET MVC and Visual Studio.

> Microsoft is looking to make jQuery part of their official development platform. Their JavaScript offering today includes the ASP.NET Ajax Framework and theyâ€™re looking to expand it with the use of jQuery. This means that jQuery will be distributed with Visual Studio (which will include jQuery intellisense, snippets, examples, and documentation).</p>

Sweet, you will get jQuery intellisense ðŸ™‚
