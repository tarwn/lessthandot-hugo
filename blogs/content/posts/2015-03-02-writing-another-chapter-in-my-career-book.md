On Tuesday, I have to decide: which lunchbox do I take to my first day of work &#8211; Star Wars or Wonder Woman?

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lunchboxes-300x169.jpg" alt="lunchboxes" width="300" height="169" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lunchboxes-300x169.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lunchboxes-1024x579.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]

That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m heading into a new office to start my first day at a new job!

After three years with the crazy-smart crew at Brent Ozar Unlimited, I&#8217;m closing that chapter and starting the next. I&#8217;ll be a Senior SQL Server Engineer at <a href="http://www.concurrency.com/" target="_blank">Concurrency</a>, a Brookfield, WI-based Microsoft partner and consultancy.

The breadth of projects I&#8217;ll get to work on, and knowing I&#8217;ll be able to put my depth of SQL Server knowledge to work immediately, was a big factor in my decision. But the big draw for me is the really smart, passionate people I&#8217;ll be working side-by-side with. Concurrency values and draws thought leaders and experts in each field they consult in. I&#8217;ll be joining six other Microsoft MVPs, which shows how much Concurrency values contributions to technical communities, as well.

Time to go pack my lunch!
