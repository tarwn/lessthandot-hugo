Visual Studio 2010 has been made available to MSDN subscribers yesterday. I downloaded Visual Studio 2010 today and installed it on Windows 7 RC. I took some images so that you can see what it looks like

The new welcome screen in Visual Studio 2010

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20101.png?mtime=1357606093"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20101.png?mtime=1357606093" width="735" height="521" /></a>
</div>

In Visual Studio 2010 you can target frameworks 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20102.png?mtime=1357606111"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20102.png?mtime=1357606111" width="605" height="657" /></a>
</div>

The toolbox has changed in Visual Studio 2010. it looks a lot cleaner to me. Finally we have a toolbox which does not resemble the Visual Basic 4 toolbox anymore

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20103.png?mtime=1357606121"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20103.png?mtime=1357606121" width="864" height="643" /></a>
</div>

Finally here is what a WPF project looks like

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20104.png?mtime=1357606132"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/vs20104.png?mtime=1357606132" width="436" height="638" /></a>
</div>
