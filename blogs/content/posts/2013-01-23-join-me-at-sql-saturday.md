It&#8217;s time for a new adventure! While there have been over 200 [SQL Saturdays][1] held all over the world, this will be the first one held in North Dakota. I&#8217;m thrilled to be part of the team bringing this great event to a new location and a new group of SQL Server professionals! [SQL Saturday #175 Fargo][2] will be held on Saturday, April 27, 2013. <img style="float: right;" src="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/images/sqlsat175_web.png" alt="" width="236" height="115" />

What&#8217;s a SQL Saturday? It&#8217;s a free, one-day training event all about SQL Server. <span style="color: #2f2f2f; font-family: verdana; line-height: 19.796875px;">It is for the community and by the community &#8211; all the organizers, speakers, and helpers are volunteers. Sessions will be held for developers and DBAs, analysts and programmers; from novice users to experts in the field. Everyone that attends is sure to learn something new! </span>

<span style="color: #2f2f2f; font-family: verdana; line-height: 19.796875px;">The event is being held at Microsoft Executive Briefing Center Fargo, 4550 42nd Street South, Fargo, ND 58104, on Saturday, April 27, 2013. Attendance is free! Please <a href="http://sqlsaturday.com/175/register.aspx">register</a>, and do us a favor: invite someone you know to come along with you! We want to see SQL Server professionals in the area connect not just on this one day, but long-term. The more people that attend, the more networking there will be. We&#8217;d love to see a user group develop out of this weekend, too! </span>

<span style="font-family: verdana; color: #2f2f2f;"><span style="line-height: 19.796875px;">Do you want to share your SQL knowledge with others? We&#8217;re looking for speakers, too! Any SQL related topic is welcome. The <a href="http://sqlsaturday.com/175/callforspeakers.aspx">call for speakers</a> closes Tuesday, February 26, 2013, so hurry! </span></span>

<span style="font-family: verdana; color: #2f2f2f;"><span style="line-height: 19.796875px;">I look forward to seeing you in Fargo! </span></span>
