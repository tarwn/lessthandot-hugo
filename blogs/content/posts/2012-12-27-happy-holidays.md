<span style="text-align: justify;">It has been a great year and I look forward to the year 2013. These are some of the professional goals I have set for myself:</span>

<ul style="margin-left:20pt;list-style-position:outside;">
  <li>
    <em><span lang="EN-US">Read more technical books.</span></em><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US"> I haven't read almost any technical books in 2012 â€“ shame on me â€“ as I was too busy playing with SQL Server 2012 itself. There's a long long list of books waiting to be read and I intend to do better in 2013. The first book on my list is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Server-2012-Analysis-Services/dp/0735658188/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1356599212&sr=8-2&keywords=tabular+modeling+ssas">Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services: The BISM Tabular Model</a> by SSAS maestro's Marco Russo, Alberto Ferrari and Chris Webb.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em><span lang="EN-US">Get the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/mcse-sql-business-intelligence.aspx">MCSE Business Intelligence</a> certificate.</span></em><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US"> I got the MCSA certificate in 2012, so this is a logical next step. I'm a strong believer of certificates (I also hold the MCITP Business Intelligence for SQL Server 2008) so this is high on the list.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em><span lang="EN-US">Learn more about SQL Server 2012. </span></em><span style="text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">This is closely tied-in with the previous two points. I'd like to play around with Office 2013, the tabular model, PowerPivot and of course PowerView. I spent a lot of time in 2012 exploring the new SSIS and working for my MCSA certificate, so exploring the data visualization parts would be a nice change.</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em><span lang="EN-US">Write exciting blog posts</span></em><span style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -18pt;" lang="EN-US">. We'll see how that works out ðŸ™‚</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  <span lang="EN-US">What do you have planned for 2013? Let me know in the comments!</span>
