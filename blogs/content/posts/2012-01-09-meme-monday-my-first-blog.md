Denis started us off earlier with his [Meme Monday][1] post, &#8220;Meme Monday: what is the first blogpost you wrote and when did you write it?&#8221;.

This is a tricky question for me, mostly because my memory is poor and I&#8217;m having difficulty bending google&#8217;s time search to my will.

## LessThanDot

My first LessThanDot post was a [wall of text][2] in April 2009 that talked about bringing transparency and a definition of success to all projects, no matter how small. Since then I have added 78 more posts, finding out along the way that if you write a post with the word [&#8220;Model&#8221;][3] in it, you will get enough traffic to bring the poor LessThanDot server to its knees (and a whole lot of disappointed readers) and that apparently [standing at one&#8217;s desk][4] is far more interesting than [sarcasm and cat pictures][5].

I think the last one was the most surprising.

## But further back&#8230;

But before my LessThanDot posts I kept a private site with 10&#8217;s of hits a month. <img src="http://tiernok.com/LTDBlog/success.jpg" alt="Success!" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px .5em 1em;" />Or maybe a little less. My first post on this site was dated in August of 2002, a [Classic ASP tutorial][6] on creating files that incorporated multiple pages. 

Did it count as my first one? I don&#8217;t know. Benefits of a poor memory, I guess.

I am proud to see the site from 2002 was (mostly) HTML table-free and still looks roughly correct 9 years later (despite all the objections since that browsers just aren&#8217;t ready for table-free layouts, bitter? naah).

## Happy 2012!

Last year I posted 40 posts, including one with more than 25 pictures. Eventually I&#8217;ll get around to making some new goals for this year and look forward to seeing what everyone else at LTD posts in the coming year.
