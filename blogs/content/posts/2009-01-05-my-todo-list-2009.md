After being tagged by [AlexCuse][1] in /index.php/ITProfessionals/EthicsIT/to-do-in-alex-land-2009, I had to have a sit down and think what I'd like to get into this year.

Some of the things I've come up with are:

_**Silverlight**_

Although I can't say this is an arena I've thought of going into, it's probably something I should be aware of. At this point in time, it just seems like flash to me and I've always avoided flash so I'll have get into the right frame of mind to take this up.

_**Sharepoint**_

Although I've set up a few sharepoint sites and created some basic web parts, I've not really delved any deeper. 2009 should probably be the year that I expand my knowledge of this subject and I hope to convince work to send me on some training for this as well.

_**jQuery**_

I've really liked what I've seen with this framework, and as it is going to become a big part of ASP.NET, I want to brush up my skills and get to know the framework a bit more. I already love the amount of freely available plug-ins there are for jQuery, and it's just so easy to implement (especially AJAX type calls).

So, that's what I have planned for this year. As for tagging, I'd like to see what [Andrew Barnfather][2] has in store for the year.
