Wednesday, November 15, 2011, I became A Consultant. I am no longer a DBA. I am no longer a Developer. I am no longer a Report Writer. I am a little bit of everything. I no longer work solely with Microsoft SQL Server. I'm getting my hands dirty with MySQL and PHP, among other technologies. 

It's been an adventure so far. I knew that being a consultant would be different than being a full-time employee for one company. I knew my schedule would change, the pace of work would change, the level of work would change, and I'd learn a lot. 

And has it ever been an adventure. I won't lie, there have been a couple of moments where I've wondered if I made the right choice. I know, deep down, that I did. I've learned a lot already. I want to share the lessons I learn in a blog series, starting with these first few days of observations. 

**Ask questions** 

I don't know everything – about the office, about the clients, about the projects, or about technology. There are the typical "new job" questions – where are the bathrooms? Where is the coffee? Where is my desk? There's adjusting to new coworkers, new IM software, a new email address, and remembering to drive to the correct office. 

In addition to that, rather than working for one company, I've been working on multiple projects for multiple clients since day one. I have to learn about new industries. There are new acronyms (this is not limited just to IT, believe it or not), new laws, and new business models. This is scary. I've had a lot of questions. 

My solutions was to start a OneNote notebook for each client, with the acronyms defined, the people I've worked with listed, and any other relevant information. I have a page in that notebook for each client's projects, too, with information about what I'm supposed to be doing, the resources I have for it, and deadlines. All of this has been really helpful. 

**Rely on your network** 

Asking questions is a good start. Knowing who to ask is also helpful. 

I've learned that the network I've spent the last few years building – through jobs, Twitter, user groups, SQL Saturdays, and other events – is my most valuable resource. In the last two weeks, I have seen that people want me to succeed, they want me to do my best, and they're willing to help me do that. They've cheered me on through my first few days, asking how things are going. They've offered advice. I've had questions about PHP, MySQL, data modeling tools, and domain registrations. With every question I've asked, I've had people not only answer them, but go above and beyond to help. 

I hope I can repay this all, someday. 

**Go outside your comfort zone**

My comfort zone is...comfortable. Like my favorite running t-shirt. But if I stayed there all the time, I wouldn't learn new things. I wouldn't come up with new ideas. I wouldn't find new solutions. (I probably wouldn't be looking around the room, terrified, wondering if anyone will figure out that I don't know everything, either.) 

Outside my comfort zone, I discover new things. I uncover new strengths. I use my talents. I hope that one day, those two circles overlap. Or at least get closer together.
