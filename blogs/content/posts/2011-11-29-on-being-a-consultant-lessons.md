Wednesday, November 15, 2011, I became A Consultant. I am no longer a DBA. I am no longer a Developer. I am no longer a Report Writer. I am a little bit of everything. I no longer work solely with Microsoft SQL Server. I&#8217;m getting my hands dirty with MySQL and PHP, among other technologies. 

It&#8217;s been an adventure so far. I knew that being a consultant would be different than being a full-time employee for one company. I knew my schedule would change, the pace of work would change, the level of work would change, and I&#8217;d learn a lot. 

And has it ever been an adventure. I won&#8217;t lie, there have been a couple of moments where I&#8217;ve wondered if I made the right choice. I know, deep down, that I did. I&#8217;ve learned a lot already. I want to share the lessons I learn in a blog series, starting with these first few days of observations. 

**Ask questions** 

I don&#8217;t know everything &#8211; about the office, about the clients, about the projects, or about technology. There are the typical &#8220;new job&#8221; questions &#8211; where are the bathrooms? Where is the coffee? Where is my desk? There&#8217;s adjusting to new coworkers, new IM software, a new email address, and remembering to drive to the correct office. 

In addition to that, rather than working for one company, I&#8217;ve been working on multiple projects for multiple clients since day one. I have to learn about new industries. There are new acronyms (this is not limited just to IT, believe it or not), new laws, and new business models. This is scary. I&#8217;ve had a lot of questions. 

My solutions was to start a OneNote notebook for each client, with the acronyms defined, the people I&#8217;ve worked with listed, and any other relevant information. I have a page in that notebook for each client&#8217;s projects, too, with information about what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing, the resources I have for it, and deadlines. All of this has been really helpful. 

**Rely on your network** 

Asking questions is a good start. Knowing who to ask is also helpful. 

I&#8217;ve learned that the network I&#8217;ve spent the last few years building &#8211; through jobs, Twitter, user groups, SQL Saturdays, and other events &#8211; is my most valuable resource. In the last two weeks, I have seen that people want me to succeed, they want me to do my best, and they&#8217;re willing to help me do that. They&#8217;ve cheered me on through my first few days, asking how things are going. They&#8217;ve offered advice. I&#8217;ve had questions about PHP, MySQL, data modeling tools, and domain registrations. With every question I&#8217;ve asked, I&#8217;ve had people not only answer them, but go above and beyond to help. 

I hope I can repay this all, someday. 

**Go outside your comfort zone**

My comfort zone is&#8230;comfortable. Like my favorite running t-shirt. But if I stayed there all the time, I wouldn&#8217;t learn new things. I wouldn&#8217;t come up with new ideas. I wouldn&#8217;t find new solutions. (I probably wouldn&#8217;t be looking around the room, terrified, wondering if anyone will figure out that I don&#8217;t know everything, either.) 

Outside my comfort zone, I discover new things. I uncover new strengths. I use my talents. I hope that one day, those two circles overlap. Or at least get closer together.
