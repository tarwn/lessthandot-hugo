So by this time all of you should know that SQL Server "Denali" CTP 3 is out and about.

For all of you(like me) who rushed to download and install it, there is a little secret. There are a few feature packs as well available to accompany your new installation and Visual Studio 2010(with SP 1).

All the feature packs can be found [here][1], including the alluding Books On Line which doesn't force you to connect to the internet version.

Happy exploring and testing the new features.
