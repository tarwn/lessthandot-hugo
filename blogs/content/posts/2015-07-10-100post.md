  This is my 100th blog post here at LessthanDot!<br /> (I&#8217;m not lying, <a href="/index.php/author/koenverbeeck/">check for yourself</a>)

  I started blogging at the end of 2012, almost 3 years ago and it has been an amazing ride so far. I&#8217;ve apparently gathered almost 1.5 million views (I don&#8217;t really trust that figure :)) and 260 comments.Â Â My most popular blog post is <a href="/index.php/datamgmt/ssis/stupid-me-3-building-the/">Stupid me #3 â€“ Building the script component</a>Â with almost 100,000 views. For some reason. I still don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s the most popular post ðŸ™‚ I learned a lot while blogging and I still believe it&#8217;s a very powerful method for personal development.

  However, sometimes nice things come to an end. I&#8217;m not talking about blogging itself, but about the blog here at LessthanDot. I&#8217;m moving my blog to my own website: <a href="http://sqlkover.com/">SQLKover</a>. (<strong>Ko</strong>en <strong>Ver</strong>beeck if you are wondering)<br /> After 100 blog posts, it&#8217;s time for something new and that little something is a brand new website. I&#8217;ll continue to blog over there, but I will keep my account over here so I can still answer on comments on my old blog posts.

  I&#8217;d like to thank the LTD team for giving me the opportunity to blog for all those years and for their excellent support. I&#8217;d especially like to thank Chrissie (<a href="/index.php/author/chrissie1/">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissie1">twitter</a>) since he&#8217;s the one who convinced me to start blogging in the first place (and has had to put up with my annoying questions the most). I wish the whole LTD team and their bloggers the best of luck.

  I&#8217;d like to thank you, dear reader, as well for reading all my ramblings for so long. I hope I can welcome you at my new blog <a href="http://sqlkover.com/">SQLKover</a>!
