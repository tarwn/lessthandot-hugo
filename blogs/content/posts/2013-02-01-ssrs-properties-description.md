This blog is part of my series [Making Data Tell a Story With SSRS Properties][1].

**Property**: Description

The purpose of this property is to provide a description that can appear on the report, and appears in Report Manager when the report is published.

To access this property go to the Report properties. Choose Description.

</p>

**Example**: I have a report that shows sales per year by product category. I've given my report the description, "Sales by category, summed by year and month."

After I deploy the report, I can see the report description underneath the title in Report Manager.

This can be useful when you have similar reports that have different parameters or return different fields.
