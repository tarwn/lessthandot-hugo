A couple of days ago I posted about some stats in the [2010.. a year in stats..browsers, smartphones and windows flavors][1] post. Today we are looking at most popular posts, what the most used search engines keywords were and the top 20 countries where our visits come from.

# Countries

We got visitors from 210 countries, in the table below is the top 20. As expected the United States has the bulk of the visits.
