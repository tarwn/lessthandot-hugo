Here we are with another amazing episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show

**[A year in review, The 31 best blog posts on SQLBlog for 2008][2]**

**[SQL Server 2005 JDBC Driver and Database Mirroring][3]**
  
PSS SQL Server Engineers engineers explain the problem with the JDBC driver and database mirroring

**[Managing TempDB in SQL Server: TempDB Basics (Version Store: Simple Example)][4]**
  
Explanation of how the version store works, see also these two links:
