  I am a bit late with the almost obligatory “How was my past year and how do I think next year is going to rock” blog post – we’re already a good week into the new year – but without further ado I present you: How was my past year and how do I think next year is going to rock!

  <span style="text-align: justify;">2013 was not a bad year professional wise. I had set some goals and I managed to reach most of them (which is quite a miracle, because I excel at abandoning New Year’s resolutions at the very first chance possible). I laid those goals out in the blog post </span><a style="text-align: justify;" href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/other/happy-holidays">Happy Holidays</a><span style="text-align: justify;">. I read more technical books. Not 12 like I wanted to, but almost 10. Those books were the following:</span>
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20pt; list-style-position: outside;">
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Server-2012-Analysis-Services/dp/0735658188/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1356599212&sr=8-2&keywords=tabular+modeling+ssas">Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Analysis Services: The BISM Tabular Model</a> by Marco Russo, Alberto Ferrari and Chris Webb. It’s a great reference on the SSAS Tabular model and DAX, but it is sometimes a difficult read.
  </li>
  <li>
    Information Dashboard Design, Data Visualization: a successful design process and Say it with Charts. I wrote a review about those 3 books <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/book-review/data-visualization-book-review">here</a>. Three great books who got me up to speed with data visualization. In the summer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-At---Glance/dp/1938377001/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389040589&sr=8-1">second edition</a> of Information Dashboard Design came out and I immediately bought it and read it front to cover. It’s a great book and offers a few extras over the first edition.
  </li>
  <li>
    I was browsing a local book store and I found those two books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Intelligence-Microsoft-Techniques-Visualizing/dp/1118388038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389040636&sr=8-1&keywords=mark+stacey">Visual Intelligence: Microsoft Tools and Techniques for Visualizing Data</a> by Mark Stacey, Joe Salvatore and Adam Jorgensen and the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Excel-Charts-Graphs-MrExcel-Library/dp/0789748622/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1389040735&sr=8-3&keywords=excel+charts">Excel 2013 Charts and Graphs</a> by Bill Jelen. Actually I just went home and bought the books at Amazon, because those local bookstores sure aren’t cheap. I had the pleasure of meeting Mark in person at the Belgian SQL Server Days and he’s an awesome chap. It’s a great book he wrote and I absolutely recommend it as a great overview of all the Microsoft BI visualization options. It even gives you a taste of HTML5. Sadly, Power BI was announced after the release of the book. The Excel book was quite nice as well. A bit dry, but a very good reference if you want to find out what you can do with Excel (a lot).

    Also in the summer time a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-Dimensional/dp/1118530802/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389040993&sr=8-1&keywords=data+warehouse+toolkit">new edition of the Data Warehouse Toolkit</a> by Ralph Kimball was released. I read it and it was great to freshen up my knowledge on dimensional design. If you didn’t read any of the previous editions yet, this book is an absolute must-read.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since my (ex-) colleague Valentino did the technical review, I was very keen to do a <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/ssrs/reporting-services-blueprints">review</a> of the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sql-server-2012-reporting-services-blueprints/book?utm_source=mention.com&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=book_mention.com">SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services Blueprints</a>. A very fast read and great to get up to speed with SSRS.
  </li>

    I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Balanced-Scorecard-Translating-Strategy/dp/0875846513/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389041329&sr=8-1&keywords=balanced+scorecard">The Balanced Scorecard: Translating Strategy into Action</a> by Robert Kaplan and David Norton. It is a fundamental book regarding scorecards and performance management, but it was way too “financial” for me (read: I almost fell asleep reading the book). So I gave up half-way. No shame in that, I might finish it in the future when I’m overdosing on Red Bull.
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently I started the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Schema-The-Complete-Reference/dp/0071744320/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389041477&sr=8-1&keywords=star+schema">Star Schema The Complete Reference</a> by Chris Adamson. It was recommended by a colleague and it looks very promising. This will be my first book of 2014 and I hope I can reach 12 books in total.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Regarding the other goals: I got the <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/MSSQLServer/how-i-prepared-mcse">MCSE certification</a>, learned a lot about SQL Server 2012,<a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/other/the-times-they-are-a"> changed jobs and started writing articles</a>. The blog went all right in my opinion: I managed to squeak out 40 blog posts, with the most popular blog post at the time of writing being <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/business-intelligence-1/sql-2014-ctp1-where-is">SQL 2014 CTP1, where is my BIDS?</a> with over 31000 views for the moment. I had a couple of beers when I wrote that post, so this seems to be worth for further investigation to see if I can repeat that success formula.

  What does the year bring in 2014, aside from the 20-year anniversary of Kurt Cobains death? (Yes, we are that old). I will try to keep this blog running of course, next to the articles, and I will try to present again at a few events. SQL Server 2014 is coming up, so I’m sure there will be plenty of stuff to learn and discover. I will also try to get a better grip on data vault modelling.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Anyway, thanks for reading all those posts in 2013 and I hope you return in the following year. Have a great 2014!
