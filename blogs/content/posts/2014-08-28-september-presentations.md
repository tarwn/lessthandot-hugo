After an extended (to put it mildly) break from blogging, I&#8217;m back. One of the many reasons for less writing: more presentations!  (Another is violin lessons, but that&#8217;s another story.) Here is what I have upcoming in September. I hope you can join me for at least one!

With <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2014/Home.aspx" target="_blank">PASS Summit</a> fast approaching, PASS is holding a <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/24hours/2014/summitpreview/About.aspx" target="_blank">24 Hours of PASS Summit Preview Edition</a>. Starting at 12:00 am UTC on Tuesday, September 9, there will be 24 one-hour sessions! I&#8217;m holding down hour 16, starting at 10 Sep 2014 03:00 GMT &#8211; that&#8217;s 10:00 pm US CDT. (I&#8217;m a morning person, so this should be interesting.)

  <strong>Are Your Indexes Hurting You or Helping You?</strong><br /> Queries need your help! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make great decisions about what indexes are best for your workload. In this session, we&#8217;ll review the difference between clustered and nonclustered indexes, show when to use included columns, understand what sargability means, and introduce statistics. You&#8217;ll leave this session with the ability to confidently determine why, or why not, SQL Server uses your indexes when executing queries.
</p>

On Thursday, September 11, I&#8217;ll be presenting (remotely) for the <a href="http://detroit.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Detroit SQL Server User Group</a>. I&#8217;ve been asked to talk about&#8230;presenting! (Sense a theme with this blog yet?)

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <strong>You CAN Give a Technical Presentation!</strong><br /> You&#8217;re dreaming. In the dream, you’re standing in front of a room full of dozens of people, presentation mouse in hand, about to present to them on (insert SQL Server feature here). You wake up in a cold sweat. You’re either terrified &#8211; or excited and terrified. Are you ready to start presenting? Join Jes as she shares her secrets to building and giving successful technical presentations!
</p>

Then, I&#8217;m on a plane to Vegas to present at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/Dev14/public/enter.aspx" target="_blank">IT/Dev Connections</a>! I&#8217;ll be there Tuesday, September 16 &#8211; Thursday, September 18. This is my first trip to this conference, and I&#8217;m really excited about it. I am most looking forward to the various technologies covered &#8211; I&#8217;ve even seen a session on Fiddler that I&#8217;m interested in! I&#8217;ll be presenting two sessions on Wednesday, September 17. My presentations:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <strong>Not So Secret: Get to Know SQL Server Agent</strong><br /> Secret agents have it all: fun code names, cool gadgets, and fast cars. SQL Server Agent has operators, jobs, and alerts. These features will turn your database server into a well-tuned machine that can warn you of errors, alert you to approaching problems, and run tasks on a schedule. Learn how to increase your automation capabilities and take your notifications to a new level.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  <strong>Index Methods You&#8217;re Not Using</strong><br /> Index methods in SQL Server can enhance the performance of your queries, but you probably aren&#8217;t using them. Using examples, I&#8217;ll show you how indexed views, filtered indexes, and compressed indexes work; how they can improve performance; and what situations each is best used in. If you have a solid knowledge of index basics and want to add to your collection, this is the session for you.
</p>

After that, my sights are set on PASS Summit in November &#8211; if you plan to be there, make sure to introduce yourself, say hi, and pick up a LessThanDot laptop sticker!
