A while ago I had written some questions for an SSIS discussion. I happen to tweet that I was doing this and received some requests to post some of those questions. This was mostly out of curiosity of what I thought made really good SSIS questions. All but one or two of these questions I feel are more advanced questions that relate to SSIS and I have hopes they will indeed, test you. Then again, what I think is advanced may be extremely simple to others. In saying that, the shortened list of questions I thought were interesting for others to try answer (with or without BOL which you can open directly by clicking the diagram above [and can fully answer any of these. It is how I learned them]). It is up to you if you want to test yourself or not. I'm sure everyone will enjoy trying them out so post your answers in the comments. Don't be shy; this is how we learn from each other. My own answers may be worded as such that they are completely off too. I hope everyone that visits LTD would let me know so I don't make the mistake twice.

Â 

  1. What is an Error-Tolerant Index? 
  2. How would I implement logical or conditional precedence in SSIS?
  3. Tell me some examples you've implemented error handling in SSIS and how you did
  4. What are some logging mechanisms in SSIS?
  5. How can you achieve parallelism in SSIS?
  6. What types of things can I pass between packages in SSIS? 
  7. List and describe the SSIS architecture components.
  8. Describe a Partially blocking transformations and what components would use this type of transform in a data flow task.
  9. Explain the execution tree in SSIS. How did it change in SQL Server 2008 from 2005?
 10. If you change the DefaultMaxBufferRows in a package, what else do you need to change/ consider/relate based on your changes? How would you start by determining if you can improve performance by altering these settings? 

<p class="xmsonormal">
  In a second part to this post, I will provide my own answers to these questions. I will give it a few days before posting as to not tempt everyone to look in the back of the book for the answers. Let's just hope they are right when I give them ðŸ˜‰

<p class="xmsonormal">
  These all relate directly to SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 versions. These may also be very useful for interviews if you so want to use them.

Have fun. It's what this is for.
