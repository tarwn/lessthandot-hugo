Yes, I still use svn and yes perhaps I should try that Git thing people keep talking about. But anyway.

Since this post is for my pleasure and my pleasure only I will post a little something to remind me how to solve those tree conflicts. Because I keep forgetting how to do it.

First of all I get a message on commit saying there is a tree conflict.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/svn/svn1.png" alt="" title="" width="667" height="306" />
</div>

Than we do an update and forget to take a printscreen.

Than we do a resolved thing.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/svn/svn2.png" alt="" title="" width="384" height="287" />
</div>

Than we do the commit again.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/svn/svn3.png" alt="" title="" width="667" height="306" />
</div>

Easy as pie.
