It is very easy o learn and soak up information iwhen learning how to program. The most important thig however is that you are capable of putting theory in practice and the only way to do that is to try things.

I think it was Scott Hanselman who once said that he would look at a candidates computer and see how many ConsoleApplication he had in his Projects folder. Because ConsoleApplications typically mean that you tried something, they have little use other wise ;-).

Reading in a Blogpost what the [8 things you probably didn&#8217;t know about C#][1] are is good but I doubt most of you will remember any of it in an interview if you have never used it in real life. 

Trying those things out and seeing how they work and experimenting with them helps to remember a little better. Especially if you had trouble implementing what you learnt.

And writing about what you learnt also helps because bringing the message so that it might be understandable is more difficult than you thing. And no I don&#8217;t think I am very good at it. 

That&#8217;s also the problem with the articles.books you read. All of it is viewed from the perspective of the author. Your perspective is different.

Adapting theory into practice is what makes a mediocre programmer a great programmer. And it also one of your greatest challenges.
