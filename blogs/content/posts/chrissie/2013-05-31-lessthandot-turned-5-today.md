This site went live on the first of june 2008 after more then a year of preparation. And now the difficult part begins.

[According to about.com][1].

> For a 5-year-old, there will be many steps forward as well as steps back as she navigates new challenges and broadens her world.

We have changed servers a couple of times since she was born. We even changed providers since then.

We welcomed new members and we lost members. 

We started out to make a forum and ended up with a wiki and blog to go with that.

We noticed our blog is driving the site these days and not the forum as we intended.

We neglected her and she didn&#8217;t mind.

She doesn&#8217;t like to be renewed.

She sometimes gets attacked by spammers.

But after 5 years she is still here and doing better than we had expected.

Happy birthday LessThanDot. I hope you will happily for a long time to come.
