[Codemash][2] is an amazing event with an amazing number of [sessions][3] and some amazingly good presenters.

> CodeMash is a unique event that will educate developers on current practices, methodologies, and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby, Python and PHP.

The keynote will be be done by Ted Neward.

> It used to be easy: building an &#8216;enterprise&#8217; app meant using EJB, or COM+, or Web Services. It meant building a big, high-throughput, transactionally-oriented client/server system in a server-side-heavy topology. But (they tell us) that&#8217;s over now. It&#8217;s all &#8220;cloud&#8221;, and &#8220;mobile&#8221;: small clients accessing large servers living in a data center &#8220;someplace else&#8221;, in a high-throughput manner. Somehow it doesn&#8217;t feel any different. Neither did mainframes, for that matter. How are we end up here? What&#8217;s the new &#8220;enterprise&#8221; developer supposed to do? What about all the new stuff (dynamic and/or functional languages, &#8220;NoSQL&#8221;, and more)? Where does that all fit in?

> And what does all this have to do with geometry and history, again?

> Noted architectural expert, author and speaker Ted Neward will share insights into this topic honed over a decade of working with a wide range of organizations. An Architectural Consultant with Neudesic, LLC, Ted holds no patents, founded no open source frameworks, and invented no languages, choosing to revel instead in endless rounds of Halo, pizza, and gallons of Diet Coke.

Even more amazing is that the 2012 version of this amazing conference was sold out in less than 20 minutes. Yes, all 1200 places in less than 20 minutes. And I was one of those people that bought a ticket in the first minute. I was hoping my bosses would let me go, but apparently they won&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m giving away my ticket on Lessthandot.

<span class="MT_red">First of all, I&#8217;m only giving away the ticket. You will have to take care of Hotel and travel costs yourself. Don&#8217;t forget that codemash takes place in Sandusky OHIO. </span>

The ticket is for the three days, so precompiler and main event.

> Conference Plus PreCompiler
  
> PreCompiler attendee ticket. Access to the two main days of CodeMash (Thursday and Friday), and also includes access to the precompiler day (Wednesday). 

The competition will run for 2 weeks and will end on November the 27th. 

The question is simple, tell me why you want to go codemash in the comments on this page. 

I will pick the winner from all the candidates. I&#8217;ll try to be as honest as possible and pick the one with the best reasons.

And remember, this is a competition, you win some, you loose some. Don&#8217;t be a sore looser.

Lessthandot llc holds no responsibility whatsoever in this matter. 

So go for it.

And if you get it you can add this to your resume.
