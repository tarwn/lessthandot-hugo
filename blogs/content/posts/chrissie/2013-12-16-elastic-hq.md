## Introduction

I [tried out ElasticSearch][1] this weekend and I needed a GUI to make it speak to me a little more, because real men use GUI&#8217;s. 

And I must admit that the tooling around Elasticsearch is amazing. I started with [ElasticHQ][2]. 

## Installation

Installing it can&#8217;t be much easier. Got to the [getting started page][3] and [click start download][4]. 

Then unzip the zipfile where you can unzip it. 

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/ElasticSearch/elastichq1.png?mtime=1387181402"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/ElasticSearch/elastichq1.png?mtime=1387181402" width="598" height="266" /></a>
</div>

And then just double click the index.html file.

## The program

Now you just enter the address to your Elasticsearch server and hey presto you get everything you need.

</div>

The featurelist is quite rich and will get you up and going pretty quickly.

</div>

## Conclusion

A nice GUI always helps me get to know the product a little quicker and Elastic HQ is pretty amazing. Easy to set up and easy to use. 

Now to find out why my server is on status yellow and not green as one would expect.
