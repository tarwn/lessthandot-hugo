In dutch there is this saying.

> Een ezel stoot zich nooit tweemaal aan dezelfde steen.

A literal translation would go like this.

> A donkey never bumps into the same stone twice.

or

> Even a donkey does not bump himself twice against the same stone&#8230; 

A less literal translation would be this.

> Fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me.

So unit testing is all about being the donkey or the fool or both ;-).
