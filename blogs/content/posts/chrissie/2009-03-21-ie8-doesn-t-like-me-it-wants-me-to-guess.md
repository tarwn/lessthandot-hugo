Anybody want to make a guess which one of these is internet options?

<div class="image_block">

</div>

Perhaps it has something to do with Windowblinds I was running. And it was. Such a shame.
  
But pretty funny none the less. Which also seems to solve the last problem I had. Bad, bad windowsblinds.
