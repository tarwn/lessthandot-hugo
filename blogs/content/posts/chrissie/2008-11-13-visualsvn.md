Today, I decided it was time to try out [VisualSVN][1] (I wasn&#8217;t committing as much as I needed.)

So I downloaded and bought a license at the same time, it&#8217;s only 49 dollars and I have to help the economy. I installed version 1.5.4. First, I closed Visual studio 2008, of course (a rare thing these days). After installing VisualSVN, I had to install the new TortoiseSVN 1.5.5. I don&#8217;t exactly remember which version I had anymore but it was not enough apparently.

So after doing this, I started Visual Studio up and added the enormous license key, we can only thank God for Copy+Paste, it makes life so simple ;-). 

My first impression, I like it. It looks cool, but I noticed a problem. And I mailed it to them.
