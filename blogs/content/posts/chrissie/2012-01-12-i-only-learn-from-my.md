The above title is not entirly correct, sometimes I learn from listening to others.

In essence my best method of learning is by doing and from doing I learn. Let&#8217;s take the whole android thing. In September 2011 I saw that on of the schools in my neighborhood gave classes about android development. I thought that was interesting and I subscribed. The class was going to be for a beginner level, which I don&#8217;t really mind because I was willing to learn. 

After a few lessons (one evening a week) my hunger to learn more was growing. So I started to write some code on the weekend. And then in December I found a project that I could sink my teeth in and that was complex enough to make me go out and find answers to problems I was encountering. 

I found out how to do Async. I found out how to read from an RSS-feed. I found out what happens when you re-orientate the screen. I found out what happens when you save your files in the wrong place. I learned what it takes to put such an app on the market.

I found out by making mistakes. I&#8217;m not perfect and I&#8217;m not the greatest developer that ever lived. But I had fun and I learned. And I made something that seemed useful. And I made something I am proud of. 

Is it the most perfect piece of code you will ever see? Nope, far from it. But I had fun and that&#8217;s what hobbies are all about, having fun. And I learned a new language at the same time. 

Whatever you do, always make sure you have fun. Otherwise those 40+ years in the working force are going to be very long and hard and you will become bitter and mean.
