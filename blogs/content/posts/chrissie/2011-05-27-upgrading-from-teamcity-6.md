## Introduction

I have been running [Teamcity][1] for a while now and have been very happy with it. This week Teamcity 6.5 came out and I thought it was time for an upgrade.

## The upgrade

You can find all the reasons to upgrade on [the jetbrains website.][2]
  
I downloaded Teamcity 6.5 (dooh) and copied the file over to the buildserver. And I took a screenshot of the old teamcity window and said goodbye.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity 6.0.png?mtime=1306493133"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity 6.0.png?mtime=1306493133" width="1019" height="625" /></a>
</div>

And I clicked next here.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_1.png?mtime=1306493377"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_1.png?mtime=1306493377" width="498" height="383" /></a>
</div>

No going back now.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_2.png?mtime=1306493488"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_2.png?mtime=1306493488" width="440" height="82" /></a>
</div>

Got this and clicked upgrade.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_3.png?mtime=1306493830"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_3.png?mtime=1306493830" width="1021" height="527" /></a>
</div>

Waited&#8230;.. Long time.

And it worked as the previous version.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_4.png?mtime=1306496030"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/TeamCity/Teamcity65_4.png?mtime=1306496030" width="1225" height="677" /></a>
</div>

## Conclusion

It worked.
