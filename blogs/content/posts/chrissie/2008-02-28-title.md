Yesterday I finally installed VS2008 at work. And it was apart from the time spent pretty painless. Adapting finalbuilder turned out to be a little less painless but that is another story.

So I was surprised today that the some of the bugs are still there bu that the errorscreen has gotten an upgrade. So if you can&#8217;t make it better then make the errors nicer to look at.
