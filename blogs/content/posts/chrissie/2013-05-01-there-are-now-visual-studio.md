We all know and love [Nancy][1] by now. I love it anyway.

Up until now you needed to create an empty ASP.Net project and go from there. 

But now you there are templates to make it easier for you to start a new Nancy project.

For now only C#.

You will have to download the vsix from the [visual studio gallery][2].

The restart your VS if it was open.

If you know try to create a new project you will see this list in the web category.

</div>

Here I created a Nancy project with ASP.Net hosting and Razor. 

Here are the files it creates.

</div>

And here is the module it creates.

</div>

I&#8217;ll leave it a surprise for you to discover what is in the other files and project. But needless to say I like.

Thanks to the whole Nancy team for all the hard work.
