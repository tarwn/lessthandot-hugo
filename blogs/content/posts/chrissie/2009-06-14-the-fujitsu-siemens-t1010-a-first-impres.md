I have the FS T1010 for 3 weeks now so this is just a first impression. 

First a little about the configuration, which I think is quite impressive considering its size. 

It has an Intel P8400 processor on board with 3 GB of Ram and a 300GB HD

It gets a pretty good score from the windows experience index, namely 3.8. And this is due to the gaming graphics score. Since this is not a machine you will buy for gaming, it is a non-issue.

I&#8217;m not gonna bore you with more. And for pictures you can go to the [fujitsu website][1].

So, now my remarks after working with for a few weeks now.

The first thing I noticed is that by default, if you turn the screen and put it in tablet mode the layout would be changed to portrait, which is a real annoyance if you want to surf the interwebs with it. Not many websites are made for a narrow resolution, not even LTD. So I changed that pretty quickly. But apparently they made the scroll sensor so that it works only with the potrait layout and not the landscape layout, or rather it scrolls the wrong way then and becomes pretty useless. I haven&#8217;t yet found a way around that.

Then I found that Vista likes to add a little mouse besides your cursor when working with the pen, well the mouse is not so little and completely useless for me. I&#8217;ll just rigth-click by holding the pen down a little longer. [I wrote how to deactivate this feature yesterday.][3].

The 13.3 inch screen and the WXGA resolution (1280&#215;800) is more then enough since this makes it a portable solution and you can easily hold it in one arm while using the other to use the pen.

It is just light enough for me to carry it around everywhere. And it has more then enough power to even run Visual studio. Although I would not recommend it for your daily programming. 

Of course, the thing gets a little warm when used but I have had a lot worse then this.

Battery life is as can be expected and around 4 hours for me. 

All the other parts just work as expected. The keyboard has a nice feel to it. And it is as big as you can get on a smallish machine like this. 

This is a work-machine but next time I buy a laptop for home use it will be something like this. The touch-screen is very useful and very cool. 

I highly recommend it if you need a laptop that is actually portable.
