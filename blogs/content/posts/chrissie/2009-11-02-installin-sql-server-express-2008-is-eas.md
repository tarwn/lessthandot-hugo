I remember having a hard time [installing sql server express 2008 on windows XP][1].

So today I had to install it again on win7 I looked for the download and found it on the [microsoft website][2]. I was prepared for some more pain and a long wait like I was used to. But it started by installing the web platform installer. 

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller3.png" alt="" title="" width="945" height="637" />
</div>

So I downloaded that and installed it (not something that works by itself, it needs an extra click or two. 

And then I could click on the &#8220;Finish your installation&#8221; thing. Which showed me this. 

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller4.png" alt="" title="" width="363" height="353" />
</div>

Which was telling me to click Web platform installer and then Ok. Easy

After that, I could go on with installing SQL Server 2008 Express. Because as soon as the web platform installer launched it showed me this:

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller1.png" alt="" title="" width="767" height="570" />
</div>

Just click Install, and watch the progressbars move.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller2.png" alt="" title="" width="700" height="480" />
</div>

And after a short while it said it was installed. No reboots or anything. 

Of course I&#8217;m sure that Win7 has all the prerequisites that XP hasn&#8217;t but still I got SQL server 2008 Express installed in less than 20 minutes. 

I like it.
