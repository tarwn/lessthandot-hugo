I know when VS is tired.

Everytime I get this little message it needs a rest.

**Error 3 Visual Basic compiler is unable to recover from the following error: System Error &Hc0000005& (Visual Basic internal compiler error)
  
Save your work and restart Visual Studio.** 

It normally only does that once a day, and I have given up on sending the error to microsoft. I bet noone reads them anyway.
