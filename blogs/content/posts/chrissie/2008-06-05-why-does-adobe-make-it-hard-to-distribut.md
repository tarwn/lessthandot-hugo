Today I wanted to download Adobe Reader 8 so I could install it on our computers. Apparently Adobe doesn&#8217;t want you to do this. You have two options, Agree to their [distrubition agreement][1] (dutch version, sorry). or download it one by one on each computer which is a waste of bandwidth.

Don&#8217;t they want firms to use it anymore? What is behind this decision? I don&#8217;t know. 

In the end I did the distribution agreement. So they first send you a mail to verify you are human or a smart bot. And then they try and send you another mail which happens to be encrypted. And guess what? Our Ironport virusscanner at the mailserver level doesn&#8217;t like that. So I ask you why are they sending the second mail encrypted? Why are they making life difficult for people?
