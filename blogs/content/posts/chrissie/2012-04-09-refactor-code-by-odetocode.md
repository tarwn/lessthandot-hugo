Today on twitter I noticed that [@OdeToCode][1] (K. Scott Allen) [this tweet][2].

> A Refactoring Experiment

This leads to his [blogpost][3] about the experiment.

Where you will find a link to the github page where the code can be found. And you will also found how to go about it.

It&#8217;s a very interesting experiment. And I guess it tries to prove that tests can really help you refactor. And even make unreadable code readable. 

Can you do it?
