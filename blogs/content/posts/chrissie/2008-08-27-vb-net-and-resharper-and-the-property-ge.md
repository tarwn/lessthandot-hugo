In my [last blogpost][1] I talked about property generation and how the naming for the generated property seemed a bit strange. Luckily the guys from [JetBrains][2] ([Ilya Ryzhenkov][3]) read our blog ðŸ˜‰ and gave a [comment][4].

So I acted on it and found what he was talking about. I always use the prefix with underscore and have camelcasing because I have NHibernate setup like that too. And it becomes a habit. So I just had to add the underscore to the namingstyle, like shown in the picture.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/ResharperNamingStyle.jpg" alt="" title="" width="702" height="428" />
</div>

And then this

```vbnet
Private _color As String```
Quickly turns into this.

```vbnet
Public Property Color() As String
  Get
    Return _color
  End Get
  Set (ByVal value As String)
    _color = value
  End Set
End Property```
Isn&#8217;t that cool?
