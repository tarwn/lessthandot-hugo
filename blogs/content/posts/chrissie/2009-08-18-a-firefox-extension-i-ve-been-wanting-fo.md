Today I noticed a post on [How-to geek][1] in my rss-feeder [Modify New Tab Behaviour in Firefox with NewTabURL][2]. Now that is something I have been looking for, for a long time now. I think the default blank thing is nothing, I want my homepage to show up when I open a new tab. And I think FF should have had this ages ago. But an extension works for me. 

First of course you [install the extension][3] in FF. Then you go to the options to set it up like you can see on the how-to geek page.
  
But it didn&#8217;t work for me the first time around. The yahoo page from AVG came up instead. 

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/FFnewtaburl.png" alt="" title="" width="739" height="504" />
</div>

It has been there for a while and it really bothered me because I like google better for searching anyway and I always had to click the homepage button, I think that is one click too many. 

But you can turn that thing off. Go to options.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/FFnewtaburl2.png" alt="" title="" width="168" height="218" />
</div>

And then uncheck the checkbox that says &#8220;Show Yahoo! search box on new tabs in the browser.&#8221;.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/FFnewtaburl3.png" alt="" title="" width="593" height="506" />
</div>

And Yippee the NewTabUrlextension works like a charm now.

I&#8217;m a happy camper.
