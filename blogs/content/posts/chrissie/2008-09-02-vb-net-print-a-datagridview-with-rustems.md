Today I also needed to print the datagridview that was filled with the resutls of my queries. Instead of using a report engine, I used a tool already in my toolbox, namely Rustemsoft&#8217;s datagridviewprint class. I made another extension method (I really like those things). [You can find the code on our wiki][1].

And here is an example. I obfuscated the results just so it looks a bit more important ;-).

This is the datagridview.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/QueryanalyserDatagridview.jpg" alt="" title="" width="531" height="540" />
</div>

And this is the printpreview.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/QueryanalyserDatagridviewpreview.jpg" alt="" title="" width="316" height="416" />
</div>

And all that by just having this as the code.

```vbnet
Me.DataGridView1.printPreview(Me.TabControl1.SelectedTab.Text, "Printed On: " & Now.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm"))```
I do have to say that this method is a bit slow but I am using an older version, perhaps the new one is faster.

You can always ask question about [VB.Net on the forums][2].
