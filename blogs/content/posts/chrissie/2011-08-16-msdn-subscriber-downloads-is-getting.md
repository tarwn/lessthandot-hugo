If you have an MSDN subscription you have seen this thing for way to long.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/msdn/MSDN1.png?mtime=1313478301"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/msdn/MSDN1.png?mtime=1313478301" width="1133" height="528" /></a>
</div>

But you might have noticed the &#8220;Try the new beta site&#8221; link and when you click that, you get this.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/msdn/MSDN2.png?mtime=1313478310"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/msdn/MSDN2.png?mtime=1313478310" width="1142" height="651" /></a>
</div>

And when you click browse, products A-Z thing you get this.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/msdn/MSDN3.png?mtime=1313478319"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/msdn/MSDN3.png?mtime=1313478319" width="750" height="292" /></a>
</div>

But the whole point of a beta is that people try it out and tell MS what is wrong with it so they can decide if it is worth the trouble of fixing or by design.
