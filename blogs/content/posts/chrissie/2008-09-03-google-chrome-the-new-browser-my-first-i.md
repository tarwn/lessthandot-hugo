So I got it installed at home on a windows XP machine. It installed really quickly but you have to close Firefox so it can import all the settings from that. I&#8217;m not even sure it asked me if it could do that. I&#8217;m actually writing this blogpost in chrome.

So it loads the pages really fast and it renders the pages mainly in one go. I think it loads those pieces from the same server in one go. 

Most things work. Except for the checkbox. Somebody made a mistake and it renders the checkbox as a radiobutton but I&#8217;m sure they will get that fixed one day.

I don&#8217;t like the placement of the tabs, I probably got too used to FF and IE. 

In these widescreen days, I would like to be able to have my bookmarks (or something else) pinned on the right or left side. It would save a click.

And Lessthandot is being shown pretty much how it should be.

</div>

It doesn&#8217;t yet have many plugins like FF, but I think that will be solved soon.

Looking at the sourcecode is a pleasure, compared to the other 2 big ones. It opens in a new tab and it has colorcoding ðŸ˜€

Another cool thing is the taskmanager.

It also has built in firebug called Javascript console ðŸ˜‰

</div>

So I&#8217;m pretty happy with it, but it needs some more testing because I have already seen lots of bugs out there, but we have all been there ;-).

So try it and make it even better. This could be a Firefox killer.

I hope they get a redistributing version.
