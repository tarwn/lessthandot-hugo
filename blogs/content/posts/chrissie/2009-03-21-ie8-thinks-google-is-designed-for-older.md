I thought this was pretty funny.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/IE8.jpg" alt="" title="" width="996" height="493" />
</div>

And running it in comptabiliy view is not helping. And how do they think I&#8217;m going to type anything in that very small textbox and the tiny buttons.

Edit: [And I found a solution][1] (not that I think I had to look for one). 

> Hi, I have had this issue with IE8 and finally got round to looking for a fix rather than uninstalling it. It was suprisingly easy to fix.

> Go to Tools, Internet Options and select the Advanced tab. Under the Browsing section remove the tick from &#8220;Enable visual styles on buttons and controls in webpages&#8221; and click on OK, the change should be instant.
