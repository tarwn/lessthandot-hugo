If you want to learn then you have to read and I read blogs (among other things). But how do you find the good things to read? It takes a while to find the good blogs, so here is a little list.

Most of these guys do C# programming so I have to translate to adapt it to my situation but I don&#8217;t mind.

Lets start with [Ayende Rahien][1] he is the maker of much useful software like Rhino mocks and some other things starting with Rhino. He posts a lot, usually more than once a day.

Then I also follow [Jeff Atwood][2] he usually posts multiple times a day, not only about software development, but also about hardware and other stuff.

I also follow [Scott Hanselman][3], his podcasts are really good and his babysmash program is an interesting way to learn WPF (and no, I never thought he was smashing babies ;-), well, perhaps a few seconds).

[Roy Osherove][4] a member of the team that are writing [Typemock][5]. 

Some bloggers have come together and make it easier to follow several people. One of them is [devlicio.us][6]. This blog is mostly .net and usually on a daily basis.

Then we have [LosTechies.com][7] It&#8217;s about the same principle as Devlicio.us. 

A third &#8220;collection&#8221; of blogs can be found at [CodeBetter.com][8].

Some honorable mentions (blogs I have found in the last few weeks): [Yet another language geek][9], someone who works on the C# compiler team; [Leaning into windows][10], another VB user; [I am not myself][11], another person who is finding his way through the Alt.Net stack.

If you have some more. Please add them to the comments.
