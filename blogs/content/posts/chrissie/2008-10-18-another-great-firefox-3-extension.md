If ever you need a reason to switch to Firefox, it would be the great extensions that it has.

I stumbled across this one just today. It is called Googlepreview.

And this is what happens if you search for Lessthandot in google.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/googlepreview.jpg" alt="" title="" width="747" height="772" />
</div>

Look at the preview thumbnail and also look at the page rank it provides.
