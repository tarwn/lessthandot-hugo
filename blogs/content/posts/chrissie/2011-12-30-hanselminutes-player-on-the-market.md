After a few weeks of work (having fun) I decided that the next step would be to publish my first attempt at a real android app. That real android app was the Hanselminutes player for which you can find the [sourcecode on github.][1] 

And you can find the app on the [market][2].

My first attempt was just for android 3.2 and above, but I changed that today to make it 2.2 and above.

Here are the screen shots.
