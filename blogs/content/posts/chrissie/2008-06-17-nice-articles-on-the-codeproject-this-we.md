Because I want you all to save some time ;-). I selected a couple of very nice articles that I read on the codeproject site this week.

First up [NHibernate Best Practices with ASP.NET, 1.2nd Ed.
  
By Billy McCafferty][1]. This is a great article about nHibernate but not only for you ASP.Neters but also for windowsforms and WPF users. nHibernate or any other **ORM** is a must have for any OO developer. I think that a good **DAL** (DataAccessLayer) should be usable for no matter what you throw at it. And this just confirms it ðŸ˜‰

I also like this article, [Dependency Injection Frameworks &#8211; Part 1 &#8211; Introduction][2] it explains the basics of **IoC** and **Dependency injection** very well. I can&#8217;t wait for the second installment.

This one, [AOP Using Spring.NET &#8211; Part 2
  
By Niranjan Kumar][3], is a little less clear and uses Spring.Net
  
But worth a read none the less. It is a follow-up to this article, [AOP Using Spring.NET &#8211; Part 1
  
By Niranjan Kumar][4].
