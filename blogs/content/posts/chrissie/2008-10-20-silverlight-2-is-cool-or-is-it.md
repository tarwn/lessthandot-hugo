[Silverlight 2 got released about a week ago][1]. And this is what [ScottGu][2] promises us.

> **Silverlight 2 is a cross-platform browser plug-in that enables rich media experiences and .NET RIAs (Rich Internet Applications) within the browser.</p> 
> 
> Silverlight 2 is small in size (4.6MB) and takes only 4-10 seconds to install on a machine that doesn&#8217;t already have it. It does not require the .NET Framework to be installed on a computer to run &#8211; the Silverlight setup download includes everything necessary to play video or run applications.
> 
> Developers can write Silverlight applications using any .NET language (including VB, C#, JavaScript, IronPython and IronRuby).</strong></blockquote> 
> 
> That looks promising, especially if you are a .Net programmer like me. But let&#8217;s not forget that I&#8217;m a programmer and not a designer so my app won&#8217;t look as cool as it could. 
> 
> I&#8217;m not convinced yet that Silverlight won&#8217;t go the same way as [flash][3]. And by that I mean that flash is being misused for advertising and moving things on a website. I hate things that flicker and move while watching a website, probably because most of those things are advertising. The whole advertising thing made people grab onto tools like [adblock plus for firefox][4], or other flash adblocking programs. 
> 
> Here are some of the suggested remedies.
> 
>   * [How to block Flash selectively][5]
>   * [SuperAdBlocker.Com][6]
>   * [Block Flash Ads in Firefox][7]
>   * [Adblocker for IE][8]
> 
> Of course we all know that [Youtube][9] does have a good application for flash movies. 
> 
> I&#8217;m not saying flash is bad. It did bring something to the webscene that was sorely needed. And that was a rich user experience. The user could finally do cool things in his webbrowser. The webpage was no longer static. There was user interaction on a scale where you could only dream of with javascript (at the time). But there was also java applets. What happened to them, how many people still use them?
> 
> So is Silverlight going to be that killer app we all want to use? Is it finally going to replace all that tedious HTML/CSS/Javascript stuff that we have to check a million times in a several thousand browser to see if we get the same result everywhere? I hope so. But since my crystal ball got broken, I can&#8217;t tell.
> 
> So I went out to see if people are coming up with any cool things for Silverlight yet. 
> 
>   * [A list of Silverlight apps with sourcecode.][10]
>   * [This is a way cool and addictive game][11]. My computer seemed to have some performance problems with it. 
>   * [Silverlight airlines][12]. User friendly? Only if you give them the manual. I&#8217;m sure my parents won&#8217;t be able to use it. But cool none the less.
>   * [Tetris][13]. I think only Cobol doesn&#8217;t have a Tetris implementation ðŸ˜‰
>   * [dr.popper][14]. Another game
>   * [Deepearth][15]Playin with maps. A bit like googlemaps.
> 
> So the cool things are happening and are possible. We will see what the future brings but I think we should start installing Silverlight, it&#8217;s out there and it will be used.
