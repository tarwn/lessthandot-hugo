Sometimes we just add references and never use them or use them and then remove it all again. And sometimes it is hard to say which reference we don&#8217;t use anymore. Well MS has provided us with a button that looks up the unused references and if it finds one, you can remove the unused references.

So how do we do it?

First we right click on our project and select properties.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Nieuw-3.jpg" alt="" title="" width="302" height="448" />
</div>

Then we go to the tab references and click on the button Unused References.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Nieuw-5.jpg" alt="" title="" width="579" height="300" />
</div>

This will open a dialog with either a list of unused references (see below) or nothing in it.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Nieuw-6.jpg" alt="" title="" width="565" height="356" />
</div>

And now you can just click remove and the references will be gone.
