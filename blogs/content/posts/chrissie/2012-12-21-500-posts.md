Well here it is, number 500, a half millennium and this is also exactly my 5th year on LessThanDot. It all started with [this post about OOP][3].

And it will all end with me giving away a Personal License for Resharper, Dotrace or DotCover (you can choose one of those three) and a named NCrunch License. Look below for more details.

I hear there are people who would not make a big thing of their 500th blogpost, they are wrong. Damnit, it took time and effort to write most of those 499 that came before this, and I&#8217;m kinda proud of that. So what shall I write about.

I&#8217;m not going to bore you with my best post, my most viewed post, my most liked post. I won&#8217;t even tell you I&#8217;m awesome, because I know you all know that. 

I was gonna ask some people to write something for this blogpost like I did for [blogpost number 400][4]. Been there, done that, boring as hell.

I could try to write my first good blogpost, but I will keep it mediocre like all of the other ones.

So I went on Google and looked up the number <span class="MT_larger">500</span>. But found it to be boring too. 

I could write about what I did in those 5 years, trust me that is even more boring.

I could talk about my future, what future? This happens to be the last day of humankind so there is no future to look forward to. 

<span class="MT_larger">Darnit, now what?</span><span class="MT_larger"></span> 

You&#8217;ll be happy to note this post is not about VB.Net so that is positive.

I could tell a joke&#8230; but I&#8217;m not very good at that. Yes, I know I&#8217;m not a very good programmer either and I still do that. 

Blogpost 500, my 5th year here and the end of the world and I have nothing to say. 

Except that today is the birthday of Samuel L. Jackson, happy birthday man.

December 21st is a [very boring date][5] in history it seems. Nothing exiting happened on that date. 

Oh wait this is the shortest date of the year. That&#8217;s exiting. Oops, it is the shortest day on our side of the world and the longest on the other side of course. 

If the world is still here tomorrow then I will start writing the next 500. See you on December 21 st 2017.

And now for the prizes.

I will ask 3 simple questions which you can answer in the comments and will then pick the winners ta random from the people that answer the question correctly. Don&#8217;t forget to use a working emailaddress. The first one to be come out of the draw will get to choose which license he wants the second will get the remaining license. 

[Jetbrains][1] who are sponsoring this post allow me to give you a personal license of either [resharper][6], [dottrace][7] or [dotcover][8] (you can choose one of the three). Each one of them is an unmissable tool for any .Net developer.
