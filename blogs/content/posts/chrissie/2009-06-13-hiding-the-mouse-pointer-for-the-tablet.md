I got a new tablet PC and I like it, a lot. It takes a little time to get used to. But now I&#8217;m so used to it I can&#8217;t live without it any more. Of course it is also very cool.

I got the Fujitsu Siemens T1010 with Windows Vista Ultimate on it. I will write about it later.

But first I had to solve a little annoyance. Vista likes to add an extra mouse pointer when using the pen/touch screen.
