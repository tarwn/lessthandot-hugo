You may have noticed that I did a few posts about Simple.Data the last couple of days.

Here they are.

  * [Simple.Data and VB.Net the beginning][1]
  * [Seeing the sql Simple.Data generates][2]
  * [More Simple.Data with VB.Net: adding fields and tables][3]
  * [Simple.Data and complex types: many to one][4]
  * [Simple.Data and complex types: many to many][5]
  * [Simple.Data and complex types: one to many][6]
  * [Simple.Data and VB.Net The final queries][7]

And to make it easier on you guys I also made a solution with all the examples I used and some more and put them up [on GitHub][8].

I even added a readme file, for the first time ever.
