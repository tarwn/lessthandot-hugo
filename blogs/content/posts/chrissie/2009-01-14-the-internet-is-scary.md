Today I recieved this email from Wikipedia.

> **Someone from the IP address 213.249.29.28 requested that we send you a new login password for the English Wikipedia.</p> 
> 
> The new password for the user account &#8220;myusername&#8221; is &#8220;theusername&#8221;. You can now log in to Wikipedia using that password.
> 
> If someone else made this request, or if you have remembered your password and you no longer wish to change it, you may safely ignore this message. Your old/existing password will continue to work despite this new password being created for you.
> 
> ~Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  
> http://en.wikipedia.org</strong></blockquote> 
> 
> I changed my username and password for obvious reasons. Needless to say that I didn&#8217;t ask for this change of password, I can&#8217;t even remember having an account on that site. 
> 
> But one wonders why that person tried to simply ask a new password for my account? What posseses people to try these things? 
> 
> And even more important do I feel violated by this attack on my person? Because let&#8217;s be honest each and every login I have for whatever site on the net is mine and mine alone. If people break into your house then you feel less than good about it. You feel violated. You loose convidence. If you get the robbed the same happens. Weel today someone tried to rob me but does it affect me in the same way as it would in the non-virtual world? 
> 
> And the answer is NO. It&#8217;s to virtual to be really able to touch me in that way. But it should and that is the scary bit.
