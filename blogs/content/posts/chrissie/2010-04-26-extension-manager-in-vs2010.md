One of the great new features of 2010 is the improved extensibility. And hence they added the Extension manager to manage extensions.

First thing we see if we click on Tools > Extension manager. Is the Installed extensions.

<div class="image_block">

</div>

First thing I miss on that list is Resharper. Which is weird since Resharper does show up in the online gallery.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Extensions/extension2.png" alt="" title="" width="955" height="660" />
</div>

<span class="MT_red">As you can also see from the image above is the that it is hard to see which extensions are free and which aren&#8217;t. </span>

Or perhaps I&#8217;m missing something.

To try the online gallery I choose a free one named [CoolX][1] &#8220;Cool commands for VS 2010&#8221;. 

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Extensions/extension3.png" alt="" title="" width="510" height="477" />
</div>

That was pretty painless, just have to restart VS after that.

  <img src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Extensions/extension5.png" alt="" title="" width="382" height="84" />
</div>

And voila, that&#8217;s one extension extra.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/Extensions/extension4.png" alt="" title="" width="955" height="660" />
</div>

I hope they will add the ability to search for free extensions.
