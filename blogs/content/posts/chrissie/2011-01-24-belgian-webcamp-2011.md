Today was the Belgian webcamp with [Scott Hanselman][1], [Drew Robbins][2] and [Gill Cleeren][3] and [Katrien De Graeve][4]. Needless to say I was there, yes, I know I&#8217;m not a webdeveloper but there is always room to learn. And I do some webdev for this site. 

Anyway, for me the webcamps started on saturday when we had diner with Scott, Drew, Gill, Katrien and a dozen other people. It also happened to be Scott&#8217;s 37th birthday and he doesn&#8217;t look a day older than 37. 

And here is a very bad picture of that night.

I was glad to be a part of that evening. 

And today there was the webcamp, there were around a hundred people if I guessed that correctly, but like the police I&#8217;m not very good at estimating. 

The keynote was 2 hours by Scott and covered nuget, MVC3 things and so much more. You can see all [here][5]. 

The second speaker was Katrien about HTML5 and in short, you can and should start using it now.

Next up was Gill with a talk about jquery, and I know how powerfull and fun that is.

Last talk was Scott again about OData and I will need to check that out, soon. Looks like fun. 

I learned some nice things today, most things I had already heard about but seeing these things in action makes me think about other things you can do with them. And that is the whole point of such a day. And now I need to catch up on some sleep since I also watched the Football this weekend (some of it anyway). I&#8217;m hoping for a nice Superbowl between the Packers and the Steelers. 

So I had a fun weekend and thanks to all involved.
