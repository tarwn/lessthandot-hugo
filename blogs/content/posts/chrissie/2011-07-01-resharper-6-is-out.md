Yesterday [Resharper 6][1] launched and if you are developing in Visual studio you should seriously get it. I love it and have been playing with the nightly builds and the bet, beta2, beta3, RC, RC2 for a few weeks now. I just hated that I had to install a new version nearly every single day. An auto update feature would be nice [Jetbrains][2].

Here is what&#8217;s new.

The code analysis in VB.Net still needs some work, you will get false positives from it, but they are slight edgecases. But you should never trust any tool. They are there to help not to know best. 

I just bought mine a few minutes ago and I think Jetbrains should also work on there checkout system. I had to click way to many times. If you want to take money from people then at least make it easy for me to give it to you. 

Now go download and have fun.
