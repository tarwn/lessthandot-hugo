Today I finally got [SQL-Toolbelt][1] from [RedGate Software][2] and I just had to play with it a bit. 

I especcially liked the dependency tracker and the pretty picture it produced from my Database. Look.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/SQLToolbetdependecytracker.JPG" alt="" title="" width="748" height="625" />
</div>

Isn&#8217;t it pretty? It&#8217;s art :p.
