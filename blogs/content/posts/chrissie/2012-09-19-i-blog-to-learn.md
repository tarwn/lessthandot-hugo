Yeah, no kidding. I don&#8217;t blog for you guys. I blog for me. I&#8217;m selfish and egocentrical. I&#8217;m even a little narcissistic (but then again I have good reason to be). 

Anyway, I don&#8217;t do it for you. I do it for me. 

I learn by writing. I learn by making the demos. I learn from you. 

For example in my last post I made statements that [something was impossible in VB][1] but it was possible to do in C#. And all of a sudden someone leaves a comment and tells me I&#8217;m wrong and that I forgot something. 

And you know what, he was right. I did forget that VB did that. But I learned and remained graceful in my defeat. 

My blogging about the [resharper plugin][2] learned me how complex resharper really is and how driven they are to help the community to work with their product. I got in contact with the right people that help me along.

I also learned that you can [get good service][3] if you [blog (rant) about something][4]. 

I also learned that I am not alone with my problems. 

And when did I learn all this? I learned all this in the last two weeks. 

So yeah I do this all just for me, me, me. Despicable old me. 

And so should you. 

I know it takes effort and dedication. I know it takes time and energy. I know you are timid and anti-social. But don&#8217;t worry, I am timid and anti-social too. And I don&#8217;t have much time and even less energy. 

I have written over 450 posts on this site so far and I think it made me a better programmer. 

And I&#8217;m not very good at this kind of posts so I&#8217;ll stop and let you get on with writing your next post. 

And if you want you can always do it here on LessThanDot. It is free and you get a dedicated public. Yeah, I like this site ;-).
