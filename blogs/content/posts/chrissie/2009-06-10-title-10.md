This is an anti-pattern.

```vbnet
Public Overrides Function Equals(ByVal obj As Object) As Boolean
  If obj IsNot Nothing Then
    If obj.GetType Is Me.GetType Then
      Return Me._description.Equals(CType(obj, EventItem)._description)
    Else
      Return False
    End If
  Else
    Return False
  End If
End Function```
this is better and gives the same result same

```vbnet
Public Overrides Function Equals(ByVal obj As Object) As Boolean
  Dim ReturnValue As Boolean = False
  If obj IsNot Nothing AndAlso obj.GetType Is Me.GetType Then
    Return Me._description.Equals(CType(obj, EventItem)._description)
  End If
  Return returnValue
End Function```
The anti-pattern is called the arrow anti-pattern and you can find plenty of things about it on the net and how to avoid it.

Here are some good ones.

Of course the design anti-pattern in the above code doesn&#8217;t only have that as a disadvantage. The biggest disadvantage is that ncover will never give you 100% code coverage ðŸ˜‰ because the end-ifs will never be reached.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/ncover/ncover3.png" alt="" title="" width="479" height="156" />
</div>

That in itself is a good reason not to write it. Because you are writting code that will never be used ðŸ˜‰

Disclaimer: Of course it will never compile if you leave out the end if.
