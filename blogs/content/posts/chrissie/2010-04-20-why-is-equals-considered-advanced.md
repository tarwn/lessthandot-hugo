In VS2010 when you type the dot and then an E you will not get Equals in intellisense as an option.

You have to either type the q too or go to the All tab.

I also noticed I can&#8217;t change the Hide advanced members anymore. It seems to be unchecked by default.

I still think the equals method is something every OO-developer should use and know how and why to use it. If you don&#8217;t, then look it up.
