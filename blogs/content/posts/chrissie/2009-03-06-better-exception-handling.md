I read lots of blogs, More then 40 in total. And sometimes you find one that has an interesting post and then I add that to my google reader list.

The next post I found via [Jason bock&#8217;s blog][1]. It&#8217;s about exception handling and the filter posibilities VB.Net has, well actualy the abality is there in the CLR it&#8217;s just no implemented in C# as of yet. And not any time soon as it seems.

The post is by [Daniel Earwicker][2] and is called &#8220;[Fatal Exceptions, and Why VB.NET Has a Purpose!][3]&#8220;. Of course VB.Net has a reason. But that&#8217;s not the point.

I like the way he describes errorhandling and the process you go through. From trying to handling them all to handling only the generic one. 

Personally I think this is a bit better solved in Java where you have to handle excpetions this way you know which excpetions will be thrown by the class you are calling. 

Anyway it was a nice read hope you enjoy it too.
