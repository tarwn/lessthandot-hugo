Or should that have said Open source and I? 

I was thinking about the whole open source thing and my role in it. It is true that use and abuse a fair number of open source projects and I blogged about [a lot of them in the past][1]. I have however never contributed to any of them in a big way. I might have sent a few request for improvement and sent a few bugreports. I even once wrote an [automocker for NSubstitute for Structuremap][2] which I don&#8217;t think ever made it in to the code. But I don&#8217;t think any of those things I did made much impact on those projects or on me. I even made an attempt at improving [the proxy support for nuget][3] but got fairly quickly frustrated with how things were done. 

I don&#8217;t think I would ever make a good contributor to any open source project anyway since my time is limited and my attention span is even shorter. 

Blogging on the other hand is something I like to do, I might not be that good at it but no one forced you to read this. And I think that by blogging about open source projects and telling people how to use them with VB.Net I am contributing a very small bit to the community. That and trying to keep this site running keep me busy for most of the time without being overly intrusive into my social activities. 

I don&#8217;t know if my efforts are in any way appreciated by anyone but me. But that is enough I think. 

I am always willing to test any .Net open source project with VB.Net because I know that the authors usually have no interest in doing so. Knowing that documentation is nearly always lacking that can be a challenge sometimes.

I also do not think that I would pick an open source project over another project just because of it&#8217;s open sourceness. It has to bring something to the table that is new or better than the other. Time is not plentiful for me so I try to spend it wisely.

So there now you know how incoherent my brain is. And a few of my stands on open source in the .Net community.
