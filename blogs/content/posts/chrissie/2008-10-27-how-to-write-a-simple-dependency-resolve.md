There is a great webcast on [dnrTV][1] this week. It shows you everything you need to know about Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control. If these things are a mystery to you, then watch this webcast. It takes 1 hour and 2 minutes. But it is really worth it. And perhaps it will also teach you how TDD works and what benefits that has.

This is the short description.

> **[James Kovacs][2] shows very clearly how to code up a simple IoC container with just a few lines of code illustrating the concepts of dependency injection, dependency inversion, and inversion of control (IoC).**

The webcast can be found [here][3].

The explanation was done by [James Kovacs][2].

> **[James Kovacs][2] is an independent architect, developer, trainer, and jack-of-all-trades, specializing in agile development using the .NET Framework. He is passionate about helping developers create flexible software using test-driven development (TDD), unit testing, object-relational mapping, dependency injection, refactoring, continuous integration, and related techniques. He is a founding member of the Plumbers @ Work podcast, which is syndicated by MSDN Canada Community Radio. He has published articles in MSDN Magazine – most recently “Loosen Up: Tame Your Software Dependencies for More Flexible Apps” in the March 2008 issue. James is a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) – C# Architecture and card-carrying member of ALT.NET, a group of software professionals continually looking for more effective ways to develop applications. He received his Masters degree from Harvard University.**

And I found a flaw in Silverlight 2 while watching this. I watched the movie in fullscreen mode which worked great, apart from the fact that the screensaver isn&#8217;t informed of the fact that I am watching something which usually means I&#8217;m very quiet and don&#8217;t move the mouse, so it kept popping up. Thank you, Silverlight.
