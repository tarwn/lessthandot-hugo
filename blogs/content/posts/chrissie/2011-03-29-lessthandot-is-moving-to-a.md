If memory serves us right we have had the current server for 4 years now. And it&#8217;s time to switch to a new one which is cheaper and better. Our local sysadmin, damber, will be doing this over the next week, so there will be a little down time and we will be changing IP-address so there might be a little lag there too.

If you have to miss your favorite site for a little while this week, don&#8217;t worry, we will be back. damber is very competent and I&#8217;m sure it will be done with the least down time possible. When exactly damber will be doing this is not yet known. It depends on godaddy for one and damber&#8217;s time.

Hoping you bear with us.

The LTDAdmins.
