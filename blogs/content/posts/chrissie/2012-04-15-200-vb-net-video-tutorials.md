There is this nice person on Youtube that made a huge number of VB.Net Video tutorials. 

You can find the [200 videos on his channel][1]. There is over 20 hours of videos available there

These videos seem to be from [the new Boston site][2] that has plenty more free videos for you on many subjects.

Thanks to user [Langsomt][3] at [VBIB][4] for bringing [this to my attention][5].
