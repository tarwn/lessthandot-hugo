Last week I switched from Windows 8 to Ubuntu 14.04 because Win 8 was constantly freezing my machine and is a shitty Operating system for the desktop. 

So now was the time to play a bit more with mono and monodevelop. 

Here are my steps to get it working.

Some of it I got from [here][1] and some from http://superuser.com/questions/309168/error-visual-basic-net-compiler-not-found-mono-2-6-7-first-mononet-app.<pre lang=bash> sudo apt-get install git automake gnome-sharp2 mono-xsp4 git clone https://github.com/mono/monodevelop.git cd monodevelop sudo apt-get install libglade2.0-cil-dev sudo apt-get install monodoc-base sudo apt-get install monodevelop mono-vbnc ./configure -â€“profile=stable sudo make </pre> 

And when all that is done. You can.<pre lang=bash>sudo make run</pre> 

Now you can create a new consoleapplication.

And see the magic happen when we click the run button.

And now you are wondering where your output is.
  
So was I.
  
I was stumped.
  
But not to worry it is there in the bash window which you used to do make run.

All&#8217;s well that ends well.
