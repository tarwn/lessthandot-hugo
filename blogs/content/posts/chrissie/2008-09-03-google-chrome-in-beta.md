First, I would like to ask myself why do we need another browser? Well, because competition is a good thing. But is it really competition and from who will it steal the market share? I&#8217;m pretty sure it will steal from Firefox and the other lesser used browsers, because those are the people that actually take the effort to install something different than Internet Explorer. The IE users either don&#8217;t have a choice or they just aren&#8217;t computer savvy enough to know there are other things out there (like aliens).

Second, it seems that this version is based on the Apple Webkit (AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.149.27 Safari/525.13). I kinda like the apple browser but I don&#8217;t use it all that often. 

So, first order of business is downloading it. You can find it very easily via Google (duh). They even added a link to it on their frontpage. Like this.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/GoogleChrome.jpg" alt="" title="" width="609" height="410" />
</div>

This is only a 475kb download file. But at work it doesn&#8217;t download that fast, so I had to wait for it.

Stay tuned for the second episode when I actually get it installed.
