I kinda like this new feature that is apparently based on an extension that was there in previous version of VS. At least that&#8217;s what [Xavier Decoster][1] told me.

It lets you create views on the solution explorer so you can have less files in it. Very handy when you are working on a certain feature. Especially handy when you have lots of little files in your code like me.

So you start of from the normal solution explorer view.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/solutionexplorer/SolutionExplorer1.png?mtime=1347968827"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/solutionexplorer/SolutionExplorer1.png?mtime=1347968827" width="348" height="734" /></a>
</div>

You then right-click on the folder or file you want and click New solution explorer view.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/solutionexplorer/SolutionExplorer2.png?mtime=1347968845"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/solutionexplorer/SolutionExplorer2.png?mtime=1347968845" width="327" height="163" /></a>
</div>

And then you get a new window with the view you requested.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/solutionexplorer/SolutionExplorer3.png?mtime=1347968860"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/solutionexplorer/SolutionExplorer3.png?mtime=1347968860" width="377" height="724" /></a>
</div>

I like that and it&#8217;s the first I heard about it. So spread the word and be jolly.
