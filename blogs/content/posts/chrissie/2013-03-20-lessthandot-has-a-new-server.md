You might have noticed a slight glitch in the Matrix yesterday.

That&#8217;s because LessThanDot is now no longer hosted on a dedicated server over at godaddy.com but we moved to [host4geeks][1]

You might be interested to know that we have moved up in the world.

Our old server was a dual core intel processor with 2GB RAM and 2x300GB disks with linux on it.

To our new server being a similar dual core intel celeron processor with 8GB RAM and 2x250GB disks. We needed the RAM more than anything. 

The transition was smooth and not too many people noticed. Except for Ted who lost a few views on his last post, sorry Ted. 

Enjoy.
