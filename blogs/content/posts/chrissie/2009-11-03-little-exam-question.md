I got a nice little exam question today. It was supposed to be all about C# but that&#8217;s another story. 

One of the real C# questions was this.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

namespace ConsoleApplication2
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                Console.WriteLine("A");
                var val = int.Parse("8A");
                Console.WriteLine("B");
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("C");
                return;
            }
            finally
            {
                Console.WriteLine("D");
                Console.ReadLine();
            }
            Console.WriteLine("E");
        }
    }
}
```
What will be the result? Without running it of course.
