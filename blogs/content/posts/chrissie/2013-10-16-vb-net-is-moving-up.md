Last years post read [VB.Net is rapidly becoming the most popular language in the world.][1]

This year the trend is continuing according to [Tiobe][2].

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/tiobe/Stats2013.png?mtime=1381909710"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/chrissie1/tiobe/Stats2013.png?mtime=1381909710" width="581" height="605" /></a>
</div>

So it goes from 0.840% to 1.933% this year.

Combined with regular Basic last year they had 6.368% this year 6.752%, so maybe a lot of VB users are moving to VB.Net but their are others it seems, maybe those people that left C#.

.Net (VB.Net and C# combined) went from 7.436% to 7.651%, which is still a lot smaller than Java or C.

For the rest we will not draw any conclusions.
