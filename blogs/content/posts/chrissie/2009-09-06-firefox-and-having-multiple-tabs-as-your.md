For some reason this really escaped my attention and I just did it by accident. And I was wondering what was happening.

Because when I clicked on the homepage button in Firefox, it opened 4 pages. Apparently that is something new or has it been there all along?

I don&#8217;t know and I don&#8217;t really think it is my favourite behaviour.

Try adding this http://ltd.local||http://forum.ltd.local|http://wiki.ltd.local to the homepage.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/firefox1.png" alt="" title="" width="593" height="515" />
</div>

Not only will you have the best of the net ðŸ˜€ but it will also open four tabs. Weird very weird 88|.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev/firefox2.png" alt="" title="" width="813" height="147" />
</div>

You get this also if you have a number of tabs open and click on user current page.

I have no idea when they added and I&#8217;m sure this is in the manual. But why would I read that?
