Well now that we have the [engine installed][1]. We sometimes also want the GUI tools to go with it.

<span class="MT_red">I would recommend a reboot however. That&#8217;s what made it work for me.</span>

Let&#8217;s go to the [Microsoft download page][2] again and find the install button.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller5.png" alt="" title="" width="639" height="400" />
</div>

Click install and then you get this, since we already installed the web platform installer in a previous post:

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller6.png" alt="" title="" width="769" height="568" />
</div>

Which will present you with this:

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller4.png" alt="" title="" width="363" height="353" />
</div>

I&#8217;m sorry to say it doesn&#8217;t install that for me. But you can [download it here][3].

Many minutes later.

We can install Management studio.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller7.png" alt="" title="" width="768" height="668" />
</div>

And then I get this window.

<div class="image_block">
  <img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/wpiinstaller/wpiinstaller8.png" alt="" title="" width="602" height="298" />
</div>

So I click check run program anyway, we will do the update later.

BTW The update can be found here:

And voila, I&#8217;m done. Not the best of User Experiences I ever had and in the end not much better then what it used to be.
