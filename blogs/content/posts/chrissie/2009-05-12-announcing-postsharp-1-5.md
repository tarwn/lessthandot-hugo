Gael Fraiteur the developer of PostSharp is proud (or so he should be) to announse PostSharp 1.5. PostSharp is one of the best AOP engines in the .Net world.

You can read more on the [bugfixes on his mantis][1] site.

[
  
And of course the official announcement][2].

Not more I can say really, except <span class="MT_red">keep up the good work</span> it&#8217;s much appreciated.
