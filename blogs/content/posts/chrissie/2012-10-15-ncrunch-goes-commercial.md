I&#8217;ve been using the beta of [NCrunch][1] for a while now and have been pretty happy with it. It has been &#8220;free&#8221; up until now. 

But the time has come for the developer of this product to make some money out of this. And we can only applaud that. Giving away things for free is one thing but it won&#8217;t last. We are not yet in the ideal universe Star Trek wants us to believe is coming in the future. In the long run someone will have to pay for all the work that has gone in to this. And [Remco Mulder][2] has chosen this path.

I think [the price][3] is more than reasonable.

You can also just [download a trial version][4] if you want.

If you are serious about your software and automated testing then you should get a tool like NCrunch, it makes life a lot easier.
