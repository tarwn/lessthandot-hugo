Dear PHP-God(s)(ess)(esses),

I would like to tell you a little story. Once upon a time there was a very nice programming language although they called it Basic. But Basic was not very userfriendly so they made it Visual. At the same time they added some real cool features. Features that made it a mature and responsible language. A nice language to write in. The two best features were

SET OPTION EXPLICIT ON 

and

SET OPTION STRICT ON

I will not explain what they do, I know that you are very smart and that you will figure it out. So PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE can you give us the same option to save us from despear. The computer really doesn&#8217;t like it that I curse and swear like that.
  
So if we could have this in version 6 I would be ever so grateful and I promise to be a nice uhm, &#8230; big boy.

Yours sincerely,

chrissie1.
