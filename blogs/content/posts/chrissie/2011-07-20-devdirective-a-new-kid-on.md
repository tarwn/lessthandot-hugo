As a software developer you need to stay on top of things by reading articles, watching screencasts, following the right people on twitter,&#8230; Of course you have to find the good stuff else you are going to waste most of your time. For this there are already several sites out there. Sites like [DZone][1] and [DotNetkicks][2] will help you find the good stuff by having a voting system. But voting is flawed concept however you look at it. People have strong opinions and most won&#8217;t coincide with yours. Just look at [Reddit][3] and the massive downvoting on most articles. 

So what&#8217;s new in [devdirective][4] I hear you ask that the others don&#8217;t have? They too have a voting system, it seems. Even with downvotes, which is something I&#8217;m not a fan of. 

<div class="image_block">

Here is [what James Avery has to say][5] about it.

> DevDirective came from the realization that 99% of the sites that host developer articles are terrible. Plastered in ads, articles are spread out across 5-10 pages to maximize their impressions, and for the most part articles are un-edited, incorrect, and quickly out of date.
> 
> When StackOverflow launched it created a better way to ask questions and get answers about programmer related topics. StackOverflow obsoleted developer forums for thousands of developers &#8211; there was no reason to trudge through the hard to navigate, ad plastered, and often incorrect forum sites.
> 
> The goal of DevDirective is to do the exact same thing to the terrible article sites that are still out there. A secondary goal is to help give great writers who are writing on individual blogs a place to get a larger readership than they can get on their blog.
> 
> So the question is how do we do it? What makes DevDirective different from the other article sites out there? Here are our four core tenants:

That promises to be a good start. Will it be better than the rest? If I knew I would be a millionaire, and I&#8217;m not, so I have no clue. 

Do they have a VB.Net section? Yes. [But it is empty for the moment][6].

So this is one to try out and see where it goes in the next few months.

Go check it out now, [DevDirective][4].
