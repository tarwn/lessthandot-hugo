## Introduction

Well this is to be post number 250 and the final one from me on this site.
  
Perhaps you like to know why I started blogging in the first place? More then 2 years ago this site started and the best way to get views is to add content and so I did that. I started blogging just to give us content. That&#8217;s how simple it is. 

## The past

It is kinda time for a &#8220;best of&#8221; I guess. These are some of my most viewed posts.

[
  
Printing to a zebra printer from VB.Net][1]

I kinda guess that was popular because the documentation for this machine sucks and this is one of the only posts covering this in VB.Net.

[nHibernate performance against Stored procedures][2]

I was going for the be-controversial-and-get-lots-of-views, and it worked ;-).

[
  
VB.Net: Single Instance application the better way][3]

This one is just a translation of what someone else did so not very proud of that.

[
  
Installing SQL Server 2008 express on Windows XP SP 2 without reading the manual][4]

Wow, I wonder why people need to read a post like that, it should be so simple, but it wasn&#8217;t.

[ITextSharp and the HeaderFooter on the first page][5]

Thanks to a lack of good documentation, something you can never have enough of in a good OSS-project.

## Best post ever

They were all goo posts. But I kinda think this one took me the most time to figure out myself.

[
  
Adding barcodes to rdlc reports][6]

## Worst post ever

If you think I wrote something bad please tell me because I couldn&#8217;t find one ;-).

## The future

Who knows, if I knew I would tell you but I don&#8217;t so I won&#8217;t.
  
If you need to know anything else you know where to find me.
