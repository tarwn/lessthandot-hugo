OpenOffice.org 3.0 is now available, but because of extreme demand you will see this message

So what is new? I would like to know also but when visiting this link http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.0/ I am greeted with this

> The requested URL /dev_docs/features/3.0/ was not found on this server.

You can download OpenOffice 3.0 here: http://www.openoffice.org/ and that link does work ðŸ™‚
