I was working on my resolution post yesterday and was going to post it on my personal blog here: http://denisgobo.blogspot.com/
  
I noticed last night on my [twitter][1] feed that [Jason Massie][2] tagged me here:
  
My list is more a to-do list for the year than a resolution, since I am as perfect as Chrissie1 having a resolution would mean I wasn’t perfect, this clearly isn’t so.

Here is what I intend to do in 2009

**Reading more books (at least 2 books a month)**
  
When I commuted to New York City from Princeton I read about 60 books a year. This was easily accomplished because my commute was about an hour each way. Now that I have a 6 minute commute this becomes a little harder. I have three kids under the age of five; two of them just entered their terrible two stage. While they are awake you cannot read because you want to spend some time with them, then there is the wife who doesn’t want to be ignored either. Luckily I don’t watch that much TV a week, maybe 3 hours max. All this leaves me with about 4 or 5 hours to read per week at home. I could read at work during lunch for 30 minutes a day and surf the other 30 minutes. I don’t know yet how this will work out but somehow I hope I can manage it.

**Answering at least 10 questions a day on various sites**
  
This should be no problem; I should be able to do this at lunch, before I start working and just before I leave to go home. I still think participating in newsgroups is one of the best ways to learn and keep up to date on a technology

**Learning Powershell**
  
I have played around for a little with PowerShell lately and must say that I really like it, since it now also comes with SQL Server 2008 there is no reason not to learn it. I can already see where I can use it for a couple of different things

**Mastering C#**
  
I admit I am not nearly as good in C# as in SQL; this is of course because 90% of the time I am using SQL Server and not C#. I would like to change that by diving deeper into the language itself, I purchased 3 C# books last month and will read them and do all the examples. Just in case you wonder what those 3 books are, they are listed below
  
[C# in Depth][3]
  
[More Effective C#: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your C#][4]
  
[The C# Programming Language (3rd Edition)][5] 

**Finishing the SQL admin hacks** 
  
This is another thing I just can’t seem to finish, I wrote the [SQL Server Programming Hacks][6] in the first half of this year; I started the [SQL Server Admin Hacks][7] the second half of this year but I am just pushing it off. just like Peter in Office Space I am thinking &#8220;Where is the motivation Bob?&#8221;

That is it for me, I will add some personal stuff to this on my [personal blog][8]

Who to tag, who to tag? Mmmm, can&#8217;t tag Chrissie1 since he is perfect, let me try the following people:

[Alex Cuse][10]
