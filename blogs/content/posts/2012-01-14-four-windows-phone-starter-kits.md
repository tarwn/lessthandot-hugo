 <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"></span> The RSS Starter Kit project was designed as an application template for building RSS-based Windows Phone applications. It will appeal to non-developers because there are only a few configuration options to set before you get a working, deployable application. It will also appeal to experienced developers because it provides a great starting place to build out a more complex RSS-based application as there are many places for custom tweaking and extending.
