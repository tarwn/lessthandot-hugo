1. Tim and Amy Ford put a lot of hard work into making this event run. They do a great job. Everyone learns, shares, has fun, relaxes, and did I mention learns?

2. <a href="https://twitter.com/SQLSaurus" target="_blank">Jason Hall</a> from <a href="http://www.sqlsentry.com/" target="_blank">SQL Sentry</a> taught his class Tempdb Parasites, and I learned about temp table caching. This is amazing! SQL Sentry also gave cruisers some amazing, to-be-jealous-of swag. If you were there, you would have gotten it!

3. Zip lining through the canopy on Tortola is amazing.

4. <a href="https://twitter.com/GFritchey" target="_blank">Grant Fritchey</a> from <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/" target="_blank">Red Gate</a> brought his A game to talk about Query Store, a new feature in SQL Server 2016…but already available in Azure SQL Database. Red Gate continues to be an awesome sponsor of the cruise, and I'm thrilled they sent Grant to speak.

5. <a href="https://twitter.com/sqllensman" target="_blank">Patrick Flynn</a> is an Ironman!

6. During Office Hours, one cruiser asked, “How do you do \*it\* &#8211; keeping up with the community/speaking/blogging, while having a family and a job?” That turned into one of the most honest discussions I've been part of on that topic. It's not easy &#8211; for any of us. It requires balance. Those conversations are what Office Hours is all about.

7. Running a 5K in Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas, is a lot of work. Those hills! Those 99 Stairs! But having two fellow cruisers along makes it a lot more fun. (Thanks Jared and Drew!)

8. The rum at John Watling's Distillery in Nassau is amazing. Belly up to the bar for a tasting and one of their house cocktails.

9. <a href="https://twitter.com/kleegeek" target="_blank">David Klee</a> of <a href="http://heraflux.com/" target="_blank">Heraflux Technologies </a>is an amazing resource for anything infrastructure related, and has great resources on his website.

10. Not that we didn't know, but <a href="https://twitter.com/DBArgenis" target="_blank">Argenis Fernandez</a> reminded us, “Security is not easy”…as he hacked SQL Server data from packets and read through dlls for dangerous data.

11. The 2017 itineraries are going to be amazing. Keep an eye on <a href="http://sqlcruise.com/" target="_blank">http://sqlcruise.com/</a> for the details!
