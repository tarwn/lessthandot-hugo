I noticed this free ebook today, figured I would share it here. I&#8217;ve obviously not read the whole thing yet, but it looks like its&#8217; pretty good info (at least for a .NET developer).

You can download it here: [Foundations of Programming @ CodeBetter][1]

I think its&#8217; really cool that someone took the time to compile all this information and get it out to us for free. It seems pretty concise also (only 79 pages, and covers a lot of big topics). 

Enjoy. Or not.

And if you do enjoy it, kick it, if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing. I&#8217;d think its&#8217; useful to non-lessthandoters as well ðŸ˜‰
