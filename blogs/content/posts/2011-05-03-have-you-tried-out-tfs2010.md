excerpt: "Several times I found myself wanting to try out different features of TFS 2010, but my only options appeared to be building a virtual machine (time consuming and requires gobs of money or an MSDN/TechNet subscription) or using a live server as a guinea pig (for some reason admins frown on this). Luckily there's an easier option, I just wasn't aware of it until last week."

Several times I found myself wanting to try out different features of TFS 2010, but my only options appeared to be building a virtual machine (time consuming and requires gobs of money or an MSDN/TechNet subscription) or using a live server as a guinea pig (for some reason admins frown on this). Luckily there&#8217;s an easier option, I just wasn&#8217;t aware of it until last week.

Microsoft has virtual machine images for a full TFS 2010 server installation, along with sample labs if you&#8217;re just getting started with TFS.

**Downloads:**

  * [Visual Studio 2010 RTM (Hyper-V)][1]
  * [Visual Studio 2010 RTM (Windows [7] Virtual PC)][2]
  * [Visual Studio 2010 RTM (Virtual PC 2007 SP1)][3]

[Brian Keller posted more information][4] on the images and what they have included as well as some information to simplify downloading the collection of .rar&#8217;s that compose each image.

Besides trying out the built-in tools, I also intend on playing with some of the additional templates that are out there for project and task management in TFS.

  * [MS Scrum Template 1.0][5]
  * [EMC&#8217;s Scrum for Team System][6]

As if that isn&#8217;t enough, there is a remarkable amount of information at [MSDN][7] on the test labs, Build process, Branching, Requirements Management, Integration, &#8230; the list goes on.
