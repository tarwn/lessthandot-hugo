  <span lang="EN-US">My name is Koen Verbeeck and I currently work as a Microsoft Business Intelligence consultant at <a href="http://www.ordina.be/">Ordina Belgium</a>. I specialize myself in the SQL Server BI stack and for some strange reason I particularly like to work with Integration Services (SSIS). Trying to get data out of those messy sources, manipulate it and stuff it as quickly as possible in SQL Server apparently does it for me.</span>

  I intend to write most blog posts about SSIS, occasionally deviating in the wider area of BI, such as Analysis Services (SSAS), Reporting Services (SSRS) or just SQL Server in general. I probably will be taking baby steps at first, writing smaller posts of content I’m already familiar with, until I get my writing skills up to speed.

  <span lang="EN-US">So how did all this began? I was playing with the idea of starting a SQL Server related blog for quite some time now and a few days ago I met Mr. Awesome himself – Christiaan Baes (<a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&author=7">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissie1">twitter</a>) for the regular people – on the <a href="http://www.sqlserverdays.be/2012/">SQLServerDays</a>. Later that day, he asked very subtle if I wanted to blog on LessThanDot. Manipulated by rascals like Axel (<a href="/index.php/All/?disp=authdir&author=613">blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Axel8s">twitter</a>) I accepted and now I have submitted my very first blog post! I appreciate the opportunity the LTD team has given me and I would like to thank them for doing so.</span>
