Apparently Jetbrains has been working on a .Net IDE that is based on IntelliJ.

The [blogpost][1] about it was several weeks ago.

And there is even a video demoiing it. Of course we all know demos can't be trusted. 

But now you [subscribe to receive early builds as soon as they are ready][2] (copy pasted that from the blogpost). 

So go ahead and do that and don't forget to check VB.Net as your favorite language. 

They are trying to brand it as a C#-IDE but we all know it isn't.
