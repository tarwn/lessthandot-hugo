I managed to survive my first PASS Summit speaking engagement! That was exhilarating, and I think it went very well! Thank you to everyone that attended my session, "Reporting Services 201: From Basic to WOW!" 

I covered a few of my favorite RS features that I think can make your reports stand out: 

  * Background images 
  * NoRows property 
  * Toggle items 
  * Matrix 
  * Lists 
  * Charts 

My presentation materials – PowerPoint and .rdls – are available for download at <http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2011/Speakers/CallForSpeakers/SessionDetail.aspx?sid=1004>. 

I love presenting this session and can't wait to do it again! 

My full PASS Summit wrap-up can be found [here][1]!
