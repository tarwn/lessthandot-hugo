All this negative junk flying around makes for a waste of a lot of time. Negative is good but there is always a positive. Although, I&#8217;m thinking&#8230;how about the real reason of me telling you I am voting for my friend, Grant Fritchey?

Honestly, look at him

Such a cuddly little teddy bear. How can you not want this guy leading? Even more, the way that light gleams off the top of his head. Don&#8217;t get me started about the sword. 

So, before everyone freaks out and says, &#8220;You wasted my time. You need real reasons to vote for someone. This isn&#8217;t a game!&#8221; Well, it&#8217;s not a game. It&#8217;s a standard of experience and honor that I know my friend will uphold. So if you are also completely sick of the negative &*@$^)@ floating around by the people that love the attention, let&#8217;s step back and just vote and get on with it. But, don&#8217;t forget that teddy bear feel this man gives us.
