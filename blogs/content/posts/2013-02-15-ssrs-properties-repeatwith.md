This blog is part of my series [Making Data Tell a Story With SSRS Properties][1].

Today I have a special guest blogger: Stacia Misner, Business Intelligence consultant, trainer, author, and speaker extraordinaire. She is one of the people I learned much from when I started working with SSRS, and it has been a pleasure to get to know her over the past few years.

[Today, she is blogging about RepeatWith][2].

Thanks Stacia!
