What was the first blogpost you wrote? When did you write it and what was it about.

Here is mine, it is from September 15, 2005, it was about something that trips people up

> @@IDENTITY returns wrong identity field
  
> When using @@IDENTITY I get the wrong results
  
> I have seen this problem posted many times on newsgroups and It actually happened to a co-worker not too long ago
  
> This 'problem' can occur when you do an insert into Table A and there is at trigger defined that fires when the insert happens and this trigger does an insert into table B.
  
> What @@IDENTITY returns is actually the identity from Table B
  
> In order to get the identity back from table A you should use SCOPE_IDENTITY() instead
