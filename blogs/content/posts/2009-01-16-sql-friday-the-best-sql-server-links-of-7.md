Here we are with another super exciting episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show
  
Here is what I found interesting this past week in SQL Land:

**[SQL Server Spatial: EMPTY vs. NULL][1]**
  
Yesterday a friend asked me if it was better to always use a value of GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY as an alternative to making a geometry/geography column nullable. OGC has its own concept of database NULL, that is [GEOMETRY] EMPTY, where [GEOMETRY] can be any valid geometry subtype (that is &#8216;POINT EMPTY&#8217;, &#8216;LINESTRING EMPTY&#8217;, etc). When I asked why it mattered, he said he was tired of putting ..WHERE&#8230;IS NOT NULL in every UPDATE of SQL Server spatial data type. Sounds like reason for a blog entry.

**[TempDB Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Allocation Bottleneck][2]**
  
This blog continues the discussion on the common issues in TempDB that you may need to troubleshoot. See also the post [here][3] and [here][4]

**[Did you know, Dropping a snapshot flushes procedure cache in SQL Server 2005][5]**
  
Snapshot feature was one of the new features that were implemented in SQL Server 2005. When you drop a snapshot created on a source database in SQL Server 2005, it clears the entire procedure cache on the server.

**[The Lesser Known Features of SQL Server Management Studio â€“ Part 3][6]**
  
Aaron Alton shows us a couple of more lesser know features of SSMS, continued here: http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheHobt/~3/513743387/lesser-known-features-of-sql-server_15.html

**[Do you focus too much on your backups???][7]**
  
Mike shows some best practices in regards to backups

**[How I Get By Without sysadmin][8]**
  
Jeremiah Peschka shows you how to get things done even without sysadmin access

**[Time to Rant : Applications and Administrator Rights][9]**
  
Jonathan Kehayias complains/rants: It is 2009, and I am shocked to find that applications today still show up with a requirement to be a sysadmin on SQL Server, and in the case of one particular application I am helping troubleshoot today, a Local Administrator on the SQL Server machine

**[Does the down economy have an impact on your job?][10]**
  
Kevin Kline ask if the down economy has an impact on your job? Leave him a comment.

**[Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes][11]**
  
Dare Obasanjo has an interesting post about the Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Scheme



That is it for this week, I will tag the weekly posts with **SQL Friday** in case you want to see the whole archive in the future
