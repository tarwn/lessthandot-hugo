About six months ago I started a new job at yet another &#8220;Agile&#8221; shop.  I joined the team because I thought the other developers seemed smart and easy to get along with, and the pair programming they practice really appealed to me.  Maybe every past experience has left me jaded, but I was expecting it to be yet another environment paying lip service to agile methodologies, but degrading into chaos when it gets to crunch time.  After making it through a few release cycles I&#8217;m pleased to report it is not the case.  I&#8217;ve been thinking alot about what is different about this company compared to previous employers lately, and I think that it really comes down to a couple seemingly small details.

## Doing it Wrong

Before looking at what&#8217;s right, I think it&#8217;s valuable to look at what&#8217;s wrong.  Things weren&#8217;t going terribly at my old job, and were slowly but steadily improving, but the process was still sub-optimal, especially with regard to discipline.  I think the biggest problem with the process at my previous company was that while development and QA followed a relatively solid agile process (short feedback cycles between QA and dev, pretty well documented requirements, etc&#8230;) the team responsible for UAT still very much followed a &#8220;big bang&#8221; approach.  Because of this, three to six months worth of development would normally need to be tested in about two weeks.  As a result, differences in requirements interpretation and bugs in the edge cases were not revealed until the last couple of weeks before a release.  This had a ripple effect throughout plan execution, leading to releases not being pushed back until the last minute and just general chaos.  Dealing with situations like this is never easy, but there are things that can make it easier.

I think a lot about what was missing at my last job, and I think most of it can be attributed to the lack of buy-in throughout the organization.  The process we were trying to follow was **tolerated** by the IT department and others that we worked with, but not really **followed**.  This lack of a consistent process made it very difficult to stay on track to accomplish our goals.  The networking guys (and probably the IT department as a whole) were worked very hard at this company &#8211; our infrastructure needed to support a couple thousand employees in over a hundred locations &#8211; so I can see why they were so quick to go into firehose mode.  What I don&#8217;t understand is how we got to the place where **every** situation was treated like an emergency.

## How it Can Be Better

I guess a lot of the reasons things have gotten better is just dumb luck.  I&#8217;m working now for a software company, and the environment is structured in such a way that we don&#8217;t really have to worry a lot about production support.  We&#8217;re still not without our emergencies, they just come from different places.  Our jobs aren&#8217;t easy, but I think we do do get to focus a lot more on the fun part of the job (writing software) than we do on the hard part (supporting it).  That being said, I&#8217;m sure that some of the most important things we do could help in a stress-filled, production supporting environment as well.

Just establishing a process is not enough.  In fact, it&#8217;s kind of the easy part.  Before putting the process in place, it&#8217;s important to figure out what you&#8217;re trying to get out of it.  And more importantly, what you think you&#8217;ll be able to provide to other areas of the company if they help you adhere to the new process.  If a process is not going to break down in times of crisis, it will need to be on solid footing not just with your group, but with other groups you&#8217;re interacting with as well.  Helping the other groups see &#8216;whats in it for me&#8217; can garner a surprising amount of belief in the new way of doing things, as long as you are genuine.  For the overworked IT department, maybe it is a quicker turnaround time on bugfixes.  For the business, maybe it is a lower defect rate and a higher percentage of on time releases.  If the process is intended to fix anything, it&#8217;s very important to know what is broken to begin with.  This can be a difficult process, but being open about your weaknesses is important when trying to make serious improvement.  This honesty can go a long way towards establishing the buy in that you need to get the new process off the ground.

## Discipline

Now that the rest of your organization started to buy in, and your fantastic new process is in place, the hard part starts.  For the rest of the time you&#8217;re working there, you are going to need to prove its merit.  This is going to take a lot of hard work, and require some tough decisions.  But I think the most important thing when trying to implement a new process is discipline.  Most folks working in IT tend to be quite skeptical, especially the veterans.  They&#8217;ve been with your company through thick and thin, and seen just about everything.  And this includes pitches for &#8216;silver bullet&#8217; cures for all sorts of problems facing our industry.  These people are the hardest &#8211; and most important &#8211; to get on your side when trying to get your new process in place.  And guess what &#8211; they just sat through your presentation yawning, thinking &#8216;here we go again&#8217;.

If you want to win these people over, there is only one way to do it &#8211; results.  And not just a few good iterations, it will take consistent results over an extended period to help these people see the light.  The way the process helps your team deal with adversity is probably going to be the most important.  Pressure has a way of revealing weaknesses, making it important to keep cool when the proverbial shit hits the fan.  Say you&#8217;re faced with a tight deadline that you&#8217;re not going to be able to meet.  It may be easier, and require a lot less grovelling, to just tell people they&#8217;re working overtime for the next _N_ weeks.  But this is going to burn your people out.  And it&#8217;s going to burn you out too.  While it&#8217;s important to be able to adjust in situations like this, it&#8217;s important to not &#8220;adjust&#8221; back into the same old habits that made establishing the new process so important.

  Estimation
</h2>

I think frequent estimation (and perhaps more important, re-estimation) really helps to maintain discipline.  Keeping the product owners informed of how much work remains for a release allows them to adjust release dates as needed, and ensure that the long-term plan for the product reflects the changing dates.
