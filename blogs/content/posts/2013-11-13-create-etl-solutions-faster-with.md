  Last week was the 2013 edition of the SQL Server Days. It was an amazing event: there was a great audience, fantastic speakers and nice booths by the sponsors (especially the bar with Belgian beer was pretty awesome). It was great meeting up with the #sqlfamily again.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Anyway, I gave a session about using <a href="/index.php/DataMgmt/ssis/speaking-about-biml">BIML</a> to generate SSIS packages based on metadata. The session went pretty well: demos didn't crash and the audience had some good questions (which I was luckily able to answer).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For those of you interested, you can download the slide deck of the session – which contains a lot of links to very useful resources – at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KoenVerbeeck/sql-server-days-2013-create-etl-solutions-faster-with-metadata-driven-development">slideshare</a>. I used a small application I wrote to upload flat file metadata to a database. You can find the code <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/SSD2013/MetadataLoader.zip?mtime=1384287593">here</a>. I do not provide any support however and using it is at your own risk. A zip file with sample flat files, the .sql scripts and the BIML script used in the demos can be downloaded <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/users/koenverbeeck/SSD2013/GenerateSSISWithBIML.zip">here</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you attended the session, I hope you enjoyed it and that you consider using BIML in your next projects.

  See you at the SQL Server Days next year!
