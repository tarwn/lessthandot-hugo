[Red Gate][1] is one of my favorite application vendors. They make easy-to-use, useful tools for SQL Server and other software. The support and development teams are top-notch. They support a lot of community events, like SQL Saturdays and Tech on Tap.

Red Gate also hosts SQL in the City events– a full day of SQL Server sessions, demos from the developers, networking – even snacks! The best part? It’s free! The tour will take them to [New York City][2], [Austin][3], [San Francisco][4], [Boston][5], and [Seattle][6]. Best of all, it will be in [Chicago][7] on Friday, October 5. If you’re near one of these cities, take advantage of the training being offered and register today!

I was planning to attend the Chicago event, but who has two thumbs and was asked to present? This girl! I’m stoked – I’m on the lineup with Steve Jones and Grant Fritchey of Red Gate, Allen White of UpSearch Technology, and Brent Ozar of Brent Ozar PLF (the boss!). That’s an all-star lineup, and we’re incredibly lucky to learn from them.

Here’s my session info:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Proactive Data Growth Management: Reducing your Storage Footprint</strong>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Organizations are storing more and more data at an unprecedented rate, forcing them to purchase more hard disk space. Are there any ways that DBAs can deal with data growth, and at the same time minimize their storage costs? Of course there is. In this session you will learn about several different options how you can use different forms of compression to reduce your organization’s footprint. These will include using Red Gate Software’s SQL Storage Compress to compress databases used for testing, development, and reporting; and how to use SQL Backup Pro to minimize your backup storage footprint.

At the end of the day, I hope they save me a Select * Ale…
