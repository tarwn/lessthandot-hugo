Today was a very sad day for me. I received news that a dear friend, Rose Waters [@SQLRose][1], whom I had the pleasure of working with, passed away yesterday. Rose was an all-around great and very intelligent, hard working person. Her energy in wanting to learn new parts of the SQL Server product line made her successful and brilliant at everything she took on. While we worked together, her motivation and ambition to learn kept me going on expanding my own knowledge sharing to the community.

Rose will be a big loss and one that hits close to home.Â  My thoughts go out to her family. She will be very much missed.

Remember to cherish each day we have with our families, friends and everything else you take on in life.
