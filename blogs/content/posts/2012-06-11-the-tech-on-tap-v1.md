To sum up my latest adventure, [Tech on Tap v1.2 SharePoint][1], here’s a simple Top 10 List – in no particular order.

10. The [Stone Cellar Brewpub][2] Scottish Ale. This was a smooth, rich beer. Yum.

9. Four excellent speakers: [Chuck Heinzelman][3], from Microsoft SQL Server CAT; [Rob Bogue][4], a SharePoint consultant and MVP; local consultant Rick Fischer; and [David Peterson][5] from Trek Bicycle Corporation. This diverse group brought a wide range of experiences and knowledge. All of them brought their sense of humor and A-game.

8. The custom pint glasses.

7. Our fantastic sponsors – [Dell][6], [Idera][7], and [Oracular][8]. The willingness of national and local sponsors to contribute to the local tech community continues to amaze me. I’m always grateful.

6. Finding out about the [Fox Valley  Sharepoint and BI user group][9].

5. Networking. I was able to reconnect with some attendees from v1.1, and meet new people from the Fox Valley.

4. Rick records demos in Camtasia and embeds them in his presentation. Have you ever wondered how you can make your demos seamless? This may be an option.

3. Learning about claims and form-based authentication from Rob. This was new to me, and really interesting.

2. Quote: “There is more than one way to skin a cat, and every one of them will kill a cat.”

1. Watching the looks on people’s faces as they progress through a day of training and networking. The excitement, thoughtfulness, and hunger to learn are apparent. It’s what keeps me going and makes me want to do this again.

Which is good, because we announced **Tech on Tap v1.3 PowerShell**, to be held on Saturday, October 13, 2012! I hope you consider joining us!
