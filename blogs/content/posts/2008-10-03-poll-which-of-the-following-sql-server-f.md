SQL Server comes with a bunch of features and services, I have created a poll, please go there and pick all the things that you use from this list below

SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
  
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
  
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
  
Service Broker
  
SQLCLR
  
Partitioned functions/Partitioned views
  
Database Mirroring
  
Snapshot Isolation
  
Replication/Log Shipping
  
Full Text

It will be interesting to see how many people use some of this stuff
  
You can also indicate why you use or do NOT use a certain feature
