<span style="color: #2f2f2f">Here is an overview of the articles I published in the lastÂ quarter of 2014.</span>

<strong style="color: #2f2f2f">INTENSE SCHOOL</strong>

  * [MCSE Prep: Overview of T-SQL Windowing Functions Part 1][1]
  * [MCSE Prep: Overview of T-SQL Windowing Functions Part 2][2]

The third and final part of this series will probably be published this month, so keep an eye on the site for more window functions awesomeness ðŸ™‚

<strong style="color: #2f2f2f">MSSQLTIPS</strong>

  * [Format Durations in SQL Server Analysis Services][3]
  * [Creating a box plot graph in SQL Server Reporting Services][4]
  * [SQL Server Reporting Services Add Calculated Series to a Graph][5]
  * [Add a linear trendline to a graph in SQL Server Reporting Services][6]

Yes, I had quite some SSRS inspiration the past months. Regarding the first tip about formatting durations: I wrote about potential issues with NULL values in the blog post [Formatting Durations in SSAS: Caveat][7].
