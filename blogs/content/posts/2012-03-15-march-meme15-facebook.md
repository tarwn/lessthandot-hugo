  This month's #Meme15 topic is on Facebook and people balance mixing family, friends, peers and co-workers.

  I think the best way for me to answer the question of how I balance mixing family, friends, peers and co-workers, is to talk my history with Facebook.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Many years prior to joining Facebook, I moved from Canada to the Minneapolis, MN area.  In 2007 I joined MySpace because most of my of American friends were on it.  At the same time, I kept getting e-mails from friends back in Canada to join Facebook.  On April 18th of 2007, I finally caved to them and joined Facebook.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It really blew my mind just how much better of a product Facebook was at the time compared to MySpace.  I was not only able to find several of my friends from Canada, I was able to find many family members too.  To give you an idea of just how large my family is, my father is the oldest of 9 siblings and my mother was the youngest of 10 siblings!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The biggest thing that Facebook gave me was the ability to easily stay in contact with people who now lived hundreds of miles away.  Like most people at the time, I was fascinated with finding people who I hadn't talked to over 10 years.  People such as those I went to <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">elementary </span>school with or worked with at my first few jobs.  It was really cool to be able to catch up and reconnect with these people.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just like many people, I can be competitive.  So when a good buddy of mine started telling how he has over 150 friends on Facebook, I knew I could top that.  I cannot remember for sure, but I believe I peaked at close to 450 friends in the fall of 2011.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In 2010 and 2011, I spent 9 weeks across 3 trips to China for my work.  I was once again using Facebook regularly while in China to keep in contact with people.  The reason I did this was two-fold.  First, the area I was in is almost exactly the opposite time of day as here (CST).  So when I would get back to the hotel from work at 6 PM, it would be 5 AM CDT.  That make it very difficult to call people and made it very isolating.  The second reason was to share images and talk about what I was experiencing out there.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Back in 2007, I really did not care who saw my status updates or any of the <span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">embarrassing </span>photos of me.  Over the next 5 years, many things changed in my life.  I met and married the most amazing woman in the world, changed jobs, bought a house and met many great people who have all influenced my life.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As things kept changing, I started thinking more and more about who was seeing what about me online.  I was also tired of the newsfeed being full of stories of people who I was not close to.  So in the fall of 2011 I decided to go through my friend list and kept only people who were family, that I was close to or who are  interesting.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Today I am down to 184 friends and I will not let just anyone be a friends with me on Facebook.  This was probably the best thing I could to do to keep using Facebook.  Now when I look at the newsfeed, it's full of things that I am really interested in seeing.  I'm also far less concerned about my privacy because these are all people that I trust.  (Facebook themselves privacy issues are another subject all together).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  My advice is to keep Facebook personal so that you can enjoy it as much as possible.
