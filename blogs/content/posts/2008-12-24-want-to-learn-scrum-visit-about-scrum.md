I noticed that a new site has been launched named [About Scrum][1]

This site is intended to be a resource for those who wish to learn about SCRUM and software project management in general. So far it is looking great, they have a couple of videos up and also a bunch of articles.

Here is a quote for you if you never looked at scrum before

> A chicken and a pig are together when the chicken says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s start a restaurant!&#8221;.
  
> The pig thinks it over and says, &#8220;What would we call this restaurant?&#8221;.
  
> The chicken says, &#8220;Ham n&#8217; Eggs!&#8221;.
  
> The pig says, &#8220;No thanks, I&#8217;d be committed, but you&#8217;d only be involved!&#8221;.

So there are pigs and chickens, mmmm what else is there? There is also a Scrum Master, I like to call these Scrum Masters Scrumbags instead ğŸ™‚
  
You will learn about the role of pigs and chickens while learning Scrum
