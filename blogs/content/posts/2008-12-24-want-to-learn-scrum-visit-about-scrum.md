I noticed that a new site has been launched named [About Scrum][1]

This site is intended to be a resource for those who wish to learn about SCRUM and software project management in general. So far it is looking great, they have a couple of videos up and also a bunch of articles.

Here is a quote for you if you never looked at scrum before

> A chicken and a pig are together when the chicken says, "Let's start a restaurant!".
  
> The pig thinks it over and says, "What would we call this restaurant?".
  
> The chicken says, "Ham n' Eggs!".
  
> The pig says, "No thanks, I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved!".

So there are pigs and chickens, mmmm what else is there? There is also a Scrum Master, I like to call these Scrum Masters Scrumbags instead ğŸ™‚
  
You will learn about the role of pigs and chickens while learning Scrum

Here is the URL again to About Scrum: http://aboutscrum.com/
