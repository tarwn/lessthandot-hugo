I didn't think my first blog post on [LTD][1] would be for a T-SQL Tuesday, but this month's topic was so timely for me I had no choice but to participate.

In case you don't know, T-SQL Tuesday is a monthly blogging event, with a different community host each month. This month's host is [Bob Pusateri][2] and the topic is all about presenting. It just so happens, I've started doing a bit of that lately!

So, how did I come to love presenting? I starting doing it. It sounds so simple, right? Well, let me assure you, it was anything but.

Those of you who know me, know that I am not often at a loss for words and the term loud has been used to describe me on more than one occasion. I have an extrovert streak in me, but that only applies if I know you or I am **quite** comfortable in the group setting I am in. I was never driven towards public speaking when in school and it was not something I pursued on my own. Â These are both things that I now regret.

Over the last couple of years I have been making a conscious effort to expand that extroverted streak and have become something of a compulsive volunteer. I am in my second year on the [PASSMN][3] board, during which time I have planned a SQL Saturday and now serve as Chapter Leader, which yes, includes some monthly speaking duties. I have volunteered in other capacities for PASS as well. Despite all of this, standing up in front of a large group, and putting myself out there to be knowledgeable enough to instruct others, was never something I had an interest in doing. Â If push came to shove, it was something I could do. Â I did not have a debilitating fear. I simply lacked the initiative/proper motivation to take those next steps. Â So what helped changed my mind you ask? Â This community.

I have been fortunate to be introduced to many, what I consider to be great, speakers over the last couple of years and many have shared stories with me about how they started out. Â To my surprise their stories mirrored mine. Â Is it possible that these experts were once in my shoes? Indeed.

Then came a couple of personal interactions, with current speakers, which turned the tide for me.

At SQL Saturday Portland 2012 I hung out with Jason Horner ([t][4]) a good deal. Â Yes, I survived. ðŸ™‚ Â I'm not sure if he remembers this but he asked me twice "if you were going to speak, what would you speak on?". Â He was a speaker at the event. Â This definitely got me thinking and I started tossing around a few ideas in my head. Â A few days later I found myself in Seattle at Summit 2012. At the PASS Volunteer Party I ran into Luke Jian ([b][5] | [t][6]). Luke had recently spoken at SQL Saturday Minnesota and I had first met him at SQL Saturday Madison 2011. Luke asked me point blank "when are we going to get you speaking!?". Â I hemmed and hawed, somewhat avoiding the question, and actually answered with a well thought out "oh, I don't know". Luke's response: "how about Madison, next year?" Â I wasn't sure of it at the time, but a timeline had been set.

Using PASSMN as my "practice venue", I delivered my first UG presentation in March and just delivered the same presentation at my first SQL Saturday, in Madison. Was I nervous, absolutely! Did I let it stop me, absolutely not. Â In fact, both presentations went very well. Â I am now, without a doubt, in love with presenting.

So what is my advice for someone, like me, just starting out? Â Throw yourself, head first, into the SQL Server community. Find a speaker you respect and pick their brain a bit. Odds are they won't bite and are willing to provide valuable insight. Feel free to ping me anytime for advice!

Thanks to Bob for hosting this topic. Â As I said.... it is very timely for me!
