### What is Report Builder 3.0?

Report Builder 3.0 is an easy-to-install, easy-to-use report authoring tool. Installation and set-up is quick. Several wizards exist to help you create appealing reports, which can incorporate graphics, charts, and maps. Whole reports or individual report parts can be published and re-used. This overview will show you what you need to do to start creating and publishing reports in a day.
