On Monday, January 26 at 12pm PT, Internet Explorer 8 Release Candidate 1 (RC1) will be released to tech and consumer enthusiasts in a total of 25 languages.

Users should visit www.microsoft.com/ie8

IT Professionals should visit http://technet.microsoft.com/ie

Developers should visit http://msdn.microsoft.com/ie

Since Beta 2, you’ll note some of the changes in RC1 include the following:

**ClickJacking protection**. The SmartScreen Filter now includes the ability to help detect and prevent “ClickJacking” which is a malicious technique of tricking web users into revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer.

**InPrivate™**. Helps to protect user’s data and privacy from being retained “locally” on a PC. InPrivate Browsing and InPrivate Filtering can now be used independently.

**Performance improvements**. Reduces the time that users must wait when starting the browser, opening a “new tab”, or loading a page.

**User interface and experience updates**. There have been several user interface changes to help ensure a better user experience.

Internet Explorer 8 RC1 will be available in 25 languages including: Arabic, Chinese (Traditional, Simplified and Hong Kong), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Polish, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Swedish

I still think that InPrivate should have been named PornMode 🙂
