In October, [I mentioned I was working on a new adventure][1]: [Tech On Tap][2]. The first event is just days away – Saturday, January 28, 2012.

What is going to make Tech On Tap so different &#8211; and so great? 

  * We&#8217;re going to have attendees from a mix of disciplines. It&#8217;s not just SQL people, or system administrators, or developers. We are inviting people from a variety of roles. 
  * We&#8217;re talking about one topic, all day. This session will be on virtualization. That is the only thing we&#8217;re talking about. That&#8217;s going to allow us to deep dive. We want 300-400 level discussions on the topic. We&#8217;re going to get the opportunity to see how this technology affects people in different positions across the organization. 
  * It&#8217;s small, so it&#8217;s intimate, and people will get to know each other. Our attendees won&#8217;t be sitting in a room of 200 people for one hour, then a room of 75 different people the next hour. The group stays together, all day, to talk and learn together. 
  * We&#8217;re drinking beer! Our events are going to be at local brew pubs. What&#8217;s better than technology and beer? 

Virtualization will be explored by three great speakers – Brian Lewis ([twitter][3] | [blog][4]) from Microsoft, Bob Plankers ([twitter][5] | [blog][6]) from UW Madison, and Grant Fritchey ([twitter][7] | [blog][8]) from Red Gate (with a little help from me). I’m definitely looking forward to the panel/Q&A/networking at the end of the day, too. 

The event is happening at [Stone Cellar Brewpub][9], in a gorgeous 150-year-old building. We have three great beers on tap for the day &#8211; Marquette Pilsner, Vanishing Vanilla Stout, and Pie Eyed India Pale Ale. 

The best part is that the training, the food, even the beer &#8211; is FREE! I have to thank our great sponsors, [Red Gate][10] and [Confio][11], for helping us make this possible. 

As I&#8217;m writing this, there are still seats available! Go to <http://techontap.org> to learn more, and [register here][12]! I look forward to seeing you on Saturday!
