I have been using Chrome for over a year now and have been very happy with it. Yesterday version 5 was released, you can get it here: http://www.google.com/chrome

I decided to look at some stats for this site and compared April of this year to April of last year. The image below has this information.

As you can see FireFox lost about 10% while Chrome gained 9% and Safari gained almost 1%. So what is going on, are the early adapters switching to Chrome from FireFox? Take a look at the [NetMarket stats][1]

<img src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/WebDev//stats.PNG" alt="" title="" width="750" height="242" />

FireFox had 24.72% of all bowser traffic in November, in April it had 24.59%, FireFox didn't gain anything in the last 6 months.

So what is going on? When Internet Explorer 6 was the dominant browser it was very easy for FireFox to grab market share. Internet Explorer 6 was a mess, Internet Explorer 8 is better but still not as good as either FireFox or Chrome in my opinion.

So what will happen to FireFox will they ever pass 25% or is this a downward spiral and within a year Chrome will have that 25% and FireFox will be at 15% or so? With all the new stuff like the Google's App Store that Google is adding to Chrome its usage will have to grow fast.

What browser do you use and did you try Chrome and if so did you like it?
