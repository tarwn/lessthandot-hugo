I have been listening to podcasts for about 3 years now. The first podcast I have ever listened to was This Week In Tech and I have been hooked ever since. Podcasts are a great way to learn something while on the go. Here is a list of stuff I listen to

**[This Week In Tech][1]**
  
This is a weekly podcast about the tech news for the week. The best episodes are the ones with John C. Dvorak in my opnion

**[.NETRocks][2]**
  
This is a show with episodes on Tuesday and Thursday, mostly about .NET but also some Open Source and JavaScript now and then. Shows with Ted Neward and Chris Sells are my favorites

**[Security Now][3]**
  
This is all about security, Steve Gibson is the host and he usually dives deep inside a topic. Take for example the multi show crypto one
  
[Security Now 30: Crypto Issues][4]
  
[Security Now 31: Crypto 102][5]
  
[Security Now 33: Symmetric Block Ciphers][6]
  
[Security Now 34: Public Key Cryptography][7]
  
[Security Now 35: Cryptographic Hashes][8]
  
[Security Now 37: Primes and Certificates][9]

**[Diggnation][10]**
  
Diggnation is hosted by Digg founder Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht. The purpose of this podcastis to discuss some of the top stories from Digg.
  
This is great to listen to on the treadmill since it is not a serious show

**[Windows Weekly][11]**
  
A weekly show with Paul Thurrott of the [Super Site for Windows][12]. Paul Thurrott isn&#8217;t a Microsoft fanboy and doesn&#8217;t hold back, if he thinks a Microsoft product sucks he will let you know.

**[Herding Code][13]**
  
A weekly podcast hosted by Scott Allen (OdeToCode),Kevin Dente, Scott Koon (Lazycoder)and Jon Galloway. The focus of this podcast is mostly develoing with the Microsoft stack

**[The Disciplined Investor][16]**
  
Hosted by Andrew Horowitz and all about investing and the markets, very interesting show and always good guests. Check out [show 64][17] with John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and The Secret History of the American Empire
