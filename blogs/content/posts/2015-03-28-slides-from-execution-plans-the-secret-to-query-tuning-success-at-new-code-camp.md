The <a href="http://newdug.org" target="_blank">Northeast Wisconsin Developer User&#8217;s Group</a> (NEWDUG) held their annual <a href="http://newcodecamp.com" target="_blank">NEW Code Camp</a> on Saturday, March 28 at FVTC in Appleton, WI. What a great event!Â <a href="http://fvtc.edu" target="_blank">FVTC </a>is my alma mater, so I love coming back for training events, walking the halls I used to see every weeknight, sitting in the classrooms I learned to code in. It&#8217;s also fun to see how things grow and change.

I gave my &#8220;Execution Plans: The Secret to Query Tuning Success&#8221; talk. I wanted developers to be more familiar with how to find and interpret SQL Server&#8217;s execution plans. I had a great audience that asked questions and even laughed at some of my jokes!
