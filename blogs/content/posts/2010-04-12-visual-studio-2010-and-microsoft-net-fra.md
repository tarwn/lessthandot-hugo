Visual Studio 2010 and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 will be available for download later today on MSDN. Right now it looks like the time that it will be available is 10 AM PDT.

Now when it is available on MSDN don&#8217;t just download it from the first place you see it, check Top Downloads first ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/bb608344.aspx ) The top downloads page uses Akamai and the downloads are much faster than the regular MSDN downloads.

Microsoft also announced that SilverLight 4 will be released to the web later this week.

You can get more infor from the Visual Studio page here: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us

The press release can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/apr10/04-11VS10PR.mspx
