 **Windows Server 2008 R2 is the first Windows OS platform to go 64-bit only**

That is right

> First and foremost, 32-bit is done. History. Archives. Windows Server 2008 R2 is the first Windows OS platform to go 64-bit only, and frankly it was high time. Customers have been unable to purchase a 32-bit server CPU for over two years now, and the advancements in CPU architectures really dictated that we squeeze as much performance out of customersâ€™ hardware purchases as possible. The move to 64-bit is a first step

Mmm, that means that I will have no choice but to deploy the 64 bit version of SQL server 2008 later on (I was planning on going to 64 bit anyway)
  
I think this is a good thing, servers should not be running 32 bit nowadays anyway.
