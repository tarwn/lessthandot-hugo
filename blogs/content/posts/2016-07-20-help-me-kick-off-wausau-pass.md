When I started attending <a href="http://wisconsin.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Wisconsin SQL Server Users Group</a> in 2009, that was the only PASS chapter in Wisconsin. Since then, we&#8217;ve expanded to include <a href="http://madpass.org/" target="_blank">MADPASS</a>, <a href="http://fox.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">FoxPASS</a>, <a href="http://westwisc.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Western WI PASS</a>, and <a href="http://wisconsinbi.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Microsoft BI Professionals &#8211; WI</a>. These chapters have provided hundreds of hours of free training for hundreds of data professionals in the last few years.

What&#8217;s been missing, in my opinion, is a lack of options for people living in north-centralÂ Wisconsin and Michigan&#8217;s UP. However, starting next month, they have a closer chapter! Jesse Seymour (<a href="http://www.jesseseymour.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseBizInt" target="_blank">t</a>) is starting <a href="http://wausau.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Wausau PASS</a>, based in (surprise!) Wausau, WI. The first meeting will be Wednesday, August 17, 2016. We&#8217;re meeting at Northcentral Technical College starting at 6:30 PM.

I&#8217;ll be presenting &#8220;Execution Plans: The Secret to Query Tuning Success&#8221;:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  SQL Server will tell you exactly what ingredients it used and steps it took to return the results of your query. By being able to read this &#8220;recipe&#8221;, you can tell where you can improve it! This session will show you how to read execution plans, what common problems can be uncovered, and what the execution plan doesn&#8217;t tell you. You&#8217;ll leave this session able to go to work, open a plan, and identify where to start fine-tuning the query.

If you can join, we&#8217;d love to see you!
