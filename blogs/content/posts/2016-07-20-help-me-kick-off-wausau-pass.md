When I started attending <a href="http://wisconsin.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Wisconsin SQL Server Users Group</a> in 2009, that was the only PASS chapter in Wisconsin. Since then, we've expanded to include <a href="http://madpass.org/" target="_blank">MADPASS</a>, <a href="http://fox.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">FoxPASS</a>, <a href="http://westwisc.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Western WI PASS</a>, and <a href="http://wisconsinbi.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Microsoft BI Professionals &#8211; WI</a>. These chapters have provided hundreds of hours of free training for hundreds of data professionals in the last few years.

What's been missing, in my opinion, is a lack of options for people living in north-central Wisconsin and Michigan's UP. However, starting next month, they have a closer chapter! Jesse Seymour (<a href="http://www.jesseseymour.com/" target="_blank">b</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseBizInt" target="_blank">t</a>) is starting <a href="http://wausau.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">Wausau PASS</a>, based in (surprise!) Wausau, WI. The first meeting will be Wednesday, August 17, 2016. We're meeting at Northcentral Technical College starting at 6:30 PM.

I'll be presenting “Execution Plans: The Secret to Query Tuning Success”:

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  SQL Server will tell you exactly what ingredients it used and steps it took to return the results of your query. By being able to read this “recipe”, you can tell where you can improve it! This session will show you how to read execution plans, what common problems can be uncovered, and what the execution plan doesn't tell you. You'll leave this session able to go to work, open a plan, and identify where to start fine-tuning the query.
</p>

If you can join, we'd love to see you! Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wausaupass-august-meeting-tickets-25795334540" target="_blank">RSVP for the event</a>, and don't forget to <a href="https://www.sqlpass.org/RegisterforSQLPASS.aspx?returnurl=https://wausau.sqlpass.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">register for Wausau PASS's mailing list</a> to be notified of future meetings and events!

Kudos to Jesse for getting this chapter started!
