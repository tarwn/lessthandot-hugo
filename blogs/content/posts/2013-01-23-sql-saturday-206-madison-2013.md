Last year, I was part of the team that brought the first SQL Saturday to Wisconsin. It was such a smashing success, we're busy organizing the second – [SQL Saturday #206 in Madison, WI][1] on Saturday, April 6, 2013!

What is a SQL Saturday? It's a day of **free** SQL Server training! It is for the community and by the community – all the organizers, speakers, and helpers are volunteers. Sessions will be held for developers and DBAs, analysts and programmers; from novice users to experts in the field. Everyone that attends is sure to learn something new! The [networking][2] is also top-notch. You'll have the chance to meet and interact with over 200 other professionals from the area, as well as SQL Server MCMs and MVPs!

What you need to know: the event will be held at MATC – Truax Campus, 3550 Anderson St, Madison, WI 53704. It will be held on Saturday, April 6, 2013. While the final schedule hasn't been determined yet, the event will run from roughly 8:00 am – 5:00 pm.

If you're interested in attending: please [register][3]! There is no cost to attend, but if you'd like a delicious on-site lunch of brats and burgers (we'll have vegetarian and gluten-free meals, too!), that's $10. Register soon, as there can be a wait list closer to the event.

Do you want to share your knowledge with other people? We're looking for presenters! Sessions will be 75 minutes in length and can be about any SQL Server-related topic. [Submit your session here][4], and hurry: call for speakers ends Wednesday, February 5, 2013!

Do you work for a company that loves to support the SQL Server community? [We're looking for sponsors][5], and have very affordable options that will give them great exposure. Please pass the information along!

I look forward to seeing you at SQL Saturday #206 Madison in April – it's going to be awesome!
