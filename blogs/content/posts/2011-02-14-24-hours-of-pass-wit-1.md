![24 Hours of PASS logo][1]

Last month, I asked a group of [amazing women][2] to submit sessions for the [Spring 2011 24 Hours of PASS][3], focusing on Women In Technology (WIT). 24 HOP will take place on Tuesday, March 15 and Wednesday, March 16, 2011. The call for speakers came and went. I was stoked when I heard that 59 sessions were submitted. 59! That’s enough for two and a half days of training! 

Only 24 could be chosen, though, and I’d like to congratulate all of the speakers that were chosen. You can find the full schedule [here][4]. 

I’m thrilled to announce that my session, Reporting Services 201, was one of those chosen! I'll be presenting on Wednesday, March 16, 12:00 GMT (8:00 AM EST in the US). Thanks to everyone that voted. I presented the session to the [WI SSUG][5] on Tuesday, and it went really well. I think everyone that attends will learn a few new SSRS tricks. 

So, your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to [register][6] for the 24 Hours of PASS sessions you want to attend! (I hope it’s all of them!) Registration is FREE! 

I hope you’re as excited about this opportunity for outstanding free training as I am!
