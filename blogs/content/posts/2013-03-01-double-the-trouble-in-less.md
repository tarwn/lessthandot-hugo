In the ridiculously titled post [I hold this blog hostage for 1 million views mahaaahaha mahahaha....][1] I told you that it took me a little over 3 years to reach 1 million views. I also said that I hoped to get the next million within 2 years, it actually took 1 year and 8 months. In between I have added 186 posts, the average views per post went from 2,739 to 3,629

If this trend continues then I should hit 3 million views by next February, it should take between 11 and 12 months

Enough of the self-congratulatory tone of this post, lets see what the most interesting post were that I wrote between hitting the first million views and today. Here are 5 of them that I think are worthy
