  It's the second Tuesday of the month, which means it's time again for #TSQL2sday! It is the 42<sup>nd</sup> installment of this blog post series and the subject is not about the <em>Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything</em> as I hoped it would be, but about <a href="http://wendyverse.blogspot.be/2013/05/its-time-for-t-sqltuesday-42-long-and.html">the long and winding road</a> that is our work life and which technologies were key to our interests and successes. In this blog post I'll talk about how I got where I am now and how SSIS played a major role in it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  About exactly 4 years ago I suddenly found myself out of a job during the financial crisis. I was an IT consultant with no specialization and little experience. Luckily I quickly found a new job through one of my ex-colleagues (always maintain your network people!) at a local BI consulting firm. I didn't know a thing about Business Intelligence (I had a bit of data mining and data warehousing in a course at university, but I can't really say it sticked), but fortunately the company was willing to invest in junior people. This is a really amazing thing to do, especially in times of crisis and I'm very grateful for the opportunity they gave me. So the first thing they did was sending me to a couple of Microsoft trainings. I followed one on Analysis Services and I was really amazed by the product. I took another one about Integration Services and I was ... not so amazed. I don't really recall why, but the product just didn't strike a chord with me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A few weeks later I was on my first BI project and my first assignment was: make some SSIS packages. I dreaded the task, but trying to make the most of it I dove into SSIS. And after I made my hands dirty with it and got over the initial learning curve, I suddenly fell in love with SSIS! I saw the possibilities the product has to offer and what amazing stuff you can do with it and I lost all the prejudices I had earlier. After some time I really wanted to expand my knowledge on SSIS, so I had the idea of answering questions about SSIS on forums. Because you learn the most about a subject by “teaching” it. By chance I noticed the SQLServerCentral newsletter in one of my colleagues' inbox, so I thought: “Why not that forum? Let's try it out.” I went to SSC, registered myself and started answering questions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Fast forward a few years. I switched jobs in the meantime but still work quite a lot with SSIS. Thanks to my involvement in SSC, I got to learn a lot of interesting people in the SQL Server community. I started giving sessions at conferences about SSIS, writing articles about it, giving trainings about it and as of late, writing blog posts about it. In a way, my passion for SSIS made me what I am today (in a professional way I mean). I still love SSIS and I like very much what Microsoft did with it in SQL Server 2012, but recently I'm realizing writing ETL isn't the only thing that matters. I'm slowly diving into the front-end of the BI solution, which is very interesting to work with. Right now I'm learning more and more about SharePoint BI – PowerPivot and Power View – and my focus of blog posts is shifting in that direction. My next session I will give at an event will not be about SSIS, but about data visualization. In other words, I might be in yet another bend in the long and winding road that is my career in business intelligence. I'm very curious to what the future will bring...
