If you have done windows forms development in the past and now you are using Windows Presentation Foundation, then you cannot help but notice that Windows Presentation Foundation uses more resources.

**

**Visual Profiler**

**Working Set Analyzer**
  
Use for analyzing the working set characteristics of your application.

**Event Trace**
