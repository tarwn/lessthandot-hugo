Over the last year many well known SQL DBAs have either changed companies or changed roles within their companies.  Now it is my turn to announce my change (not that I&#8217;m well known or even close the same league as the others!).

This may seem a bit odd seeing how the last <a href="http://www.jasonstrate.com/2012/08/august-meme15-assignment/" target="_blank">#Meme15</a> Topic was one that I suggested.

**_What are 5 (or 10) reasons why you like your job?_**

The truth is that I wasn&#8217;t actively looking for a new job.  I happened to hear that this place was hiring and decided to apply to see what they were like.  I&#8217;ve been with Ashley Furniture for about 3 1/2 years now.  The DBA team there is an amazing well oiled machine of people who really support each other.  I&#8217;ve learned and grown by leaps and bounds over the years and am really grateful for the experience.

This is my last week at Ashley Furniture and next week I will be starting City Brewery.  I am very excited about the new opportunity and the challenges it will pose.  City Brewery has a much smaller IT shop so I will be wearing many different hats including DBA and will even be getting my hands dirty with HighJump Development again.  A Canadian living in Wisconsin working at a Brewery has a nice ring to it!
