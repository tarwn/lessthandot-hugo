While many of us have fallen off on posting over the years, we still see a lot of traffic visiting LessThanDot. We know that
many of the posts here have helped answer StackOverflow questions, been tagged in folks personal collections, and 
even served to help us answer our own questions (it's always funny to google for somethign and end up at your own
post).

The content for LessThanDot has been fullt backed up and this static version has been setup. Hopefully we've managed
to preserve URLs and/or make the search engines happy, but if you do run into any problems please don't
hesitate to post an issue on github issue so we can help out.
