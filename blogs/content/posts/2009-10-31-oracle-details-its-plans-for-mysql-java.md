Oracle has updated the [Sun Acquisition FAQ][1]. The FAQ now has Oracle&#8217;s plans for MySQL, Java, Virtualization, NetBeans, Glassfish, OpenOffice, Open Source and other things.

Below are the relevant pieces from that document.

**What are Oracle’s plans for the GlassFish Enterprise (Java
  
EE) Server after the transaction closes?**
  
Oracle plans to continue evolving GlassFish Enterprise Server, delivering
  
it as the open source reference implementation (RI) of the Java Enterprise
  
Edition (Java EE) specifications, and actively supporting the large GlassFish
  
community. Additionally, Oracle plans to invest in aligning common
  
infrastructure components and innovations from Oracle WebLogic Server
  
and GlassFish Enterprise Server to benefit both Oracle WebLogic Server and
  
GlassFish Enterprise Server customers.

**What are Oracle’s plans for NetBeans?**
  
Oracle has a strong track record of demonstrating commitment to choice for
  
Java developers. As such, NetBeans is expected to provide an additional open
  
source option and complement to the two free tools Oracle already offers for
  
enterprise Java development: Oracle JDeveloper and Oracle Enterprise Pack for
  
Eclipse. While Oracle JDeveloper remains Oracle’s strategic development tool
  
for the broad portfolio of Oracle Fusion Middleware products and for Oracle’s
  
next generation of enterprise applications, developers will be able to use
  
whichever free tool they are most comfortable with for pure Java and Java EE
  
development: JDeveloper, Enterprise Pack for Eclipse, or NetBeans. 

**What are Oracle’s plans for MySQL?**
  
Oracle plans to spend more money developing MySQL than Sun does now.
  
Oracle expects to continue to develop and provide the open source MySQL
  
database after the transaction closes. Oracle plans to add MySQL to Oracle’s
  
existing suite of database products, which already includes Berkeley DB, an
  
open source database. Oracle also currently offers InnoDB, an open source
  
transactional storage engine and the most important and popular transaction
  
engine under MySQL. Oracle already distributes MySQL as part of our
  
Enterprise Linux offering.

**What is Oracle’s plan for OpenOffice?**
  
Oracle has a history of developing complete, integrated, and open products,
  
making integration quicker and less costly for our customers. Based on the
  
open ODF standard, OpenOffice is expected to create a compelling desktop
  
integration bridge for our enterprise customers and offers consumers another
  
choice on the desktop. After the transaction closes, Oracle plans to continue
  
developing and supporting OpenOffice as open source. As before, some of
  
the larger customers will ask for extra assurances, support, and enterprise
  
tools. For these customers we expect to offer a typical commercial license
  
option.

**How does Oracle support open source?**
  
Oracle has long been committed to developing, supporting, and promoting
  
open source. Oracle has been, and continues to be, committed to offering
  
choice, flexibility, and a lower cost of computing for end users. Oracle
  
has invested significant resources in developing, testing, optimizing and
  
supporting open source technologies such as Linux, PHP, Apache, Eclipse,
  
Berkeley DB, and InnoDB. Oracle continues to embrace and offer open source
  
solutions as a viable choice for development and deployment. More information
  
about Oracle’s support of open source can be found at
  
oracle.com/opensource. 

**Will Oracle continue Sun’s virtualization strategy?**
  
Yes, Oracle plans to continue Sun’s “desktop to datacenter virtualization”
  
strategy and integrate with Oracle’s virtualization products. By unifying
  
management across desktop virtualization, server virtualization, storage
  
virtualization, and network virtualization, Oracle and Sun provide
  
comprehensive, flexible, eco-efficient solutions to maximize utilization,
  
consolidate to reduce costs, increase productivity, and decrease management
  
complexity. We expect to continue Sun’s desktop virtualization products:
  
VDI, Secure Global Desktop, Sun Ray, and VirtualBox.

**Delivering increased investment and innovation in Java**
  
Oracle plans to accelerate investment in the Java platform for the
  
benefit of customers and the Java community. Java is one of the
  
computer industry’s best-known brands and the Java platform is
  
one of the industry’s most widely deployed technologies. Oracle has
  
been a leader in the Java community since the inception of the Java
  
programming language and already has the world’s largest investment
  
in the Java platform, which provides the foundation for its Oracle
  
Fusion Middleware products and its next-generation enterprise
  
applications.
  
Oracle plans to not only broaden and accelerate its own investment in the
  
Java platform, but also plans to increase the commitment to the community
  
that helps make Java an ubiquitous, innovative platform unified around
  
open standards. 

So what do you think, is there still a reason to fear what will happen to these technologies after this deal closes?
