I always wanted to be a radio star. The fame! The glory! The chaos you can cause by running War of the Worlds!

  There's a great website, <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx">RunAsRadio</a>, that frequently interviews technologists about what's hot in IT. I was asked to chat about one of my favorite topics â€“ SQL Server Reporting Services. Never one to turn down a chance to be on my soapbox, I readily agreed. You can listen to the resulting chatter <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/runas/runasradio_0260_jes_borland.mp3">here</a>.
