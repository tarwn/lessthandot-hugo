&#8211;This is intended to serve as a post for professional looking applications. This means applications that do not contain misspellings, do not have visually distracting appearances, etc.

 

How many times have you visited a site and been thrown off by how the website was designed? Does it look like a Geocities site? (And for those who don&#8217;t know what that means, feel glad and just read on.) Is the text on the site lined right up on the left-hand side of the monitor which can make it visually distracting when trying to read it without even a bit of space to alleviate it? Do you have to scroll to the right to see a picture because it hasn&#8217;t been formatted to be viewed within the context of your monitor with an option for a full-size image? Is there background sound that is squeaky and annoying when visiting the page? Do you find that some sites only work in IE (or any other single browser) but won&#8217;t render correctly in the browser you normally use?

How about applications that you have bought from various software vendors? Do you have to scroll down in a textbox that only shows 2 lines visible to see all 40 lines of text that may be contained within? Are the buttons completely visible on a page or do they cutoff because the application won&#8217;t allow you to change the size of the window? Do you have cases where you can&#8217;t even see everything that should be on a page in an application and have to click on the application and then drag your mouse down to the bottom in order to actually view everything? Or an application where clicking on a button either doesn&#8217;t work as it should or pops up some random error message (because it isn&#8217;t being correctly handled) and has to be shut down and restarted in order to get past it?

And this does not even include my pet peeve of spelling and grammar mistakes that seem to populate any application being developed today! (Disclaimer &#8211; I&#8217;m a bit of spelling and grammar nazi and seeing mistakes along these lines drives me nuts.) How many times have you seen misspellings on a site or application that just glares at you like a bear eyeing its first meal after hibernation? Or how about error messages that look like someone was texting them rather than trying to provide detailed information? These are all issues that can cause an application to look unprofessional and do not reflect well upon the companies or individuals that publish them.

This is an issue that I&#8217;ve discussed with other developer friends of mine and who argue that I&#8217;m being a bit OCD about these issues as they seem to exist almost everywhere. I won&#8217;t deny that I may be a bit OCD about them but that still does not make them look any less professional.
