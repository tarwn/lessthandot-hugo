## My New Job

As of today I am happy to announce that I have joined forces with Allen White ([b][1] | [t][2]) and Kendal Van Dyke ([b][3] | [t][4]) at [UpSearch][5].  I first met Allen when I started attending the [Ohio North SQL Server User Group][6] meetings back in 2007.  Since then, he has been both a mentor and a friend to me and now I get to add “boss” to the list.  I'm looking forward to continuing to grow as I learn from both Allen and Kendal and I'm excited as I look forward to all of the new possibilities that lay ahead of me.

With this job change I'll be able to help multiple companies, instead of just one, get the most out of their SQL Server environments.  I'll be able to help developers, administrators, and even executives learn to better utilize SQL Server and its many facets to get the most out of their data and that is exciting to me.  I truly enjoy teaching and discussing SQL Server on all levels and now, working with UpSearch, I'll be able to do that even more.  Not only will I be getting to work with multiple customers and their varied environments, I'll also be able to do more with the SQL community as UpSearch is very supportive of my community involvement.  I'm looking forward to being able to not only continue speaking at community events, but expanding and doing more than I have been able to in the past.

## Sad Endings

While I'm excited about my new career with UpSearch, I'm also saddened by the career and coworkers (friends) I'm leaving behind.  As we all know, when you work closely with people for a number of years you become friends and it can be hard to, in a sense, leave them behind.  While we'll still be in contact with each other, there is still a sense of loss when you don't speak to them on a daily basis like you once did.

## Thankfulness

As the title of this post suggests, this has truly been “A Time of Changes” for me both personally and professionally and I wouldn't have been able to successfully navigate all of these changes without my loving and supportive family.  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank them for all of the unending love and support they have given me.

I also need to thank the amazing SQL Community and #SQLFamily that has been so willing to thier experience, knowledge and support with me.  Professionally, a big part of who I am and what I've been able to do is due to the willingness of the community to share and help anyone who is willing to accept it.  I can only hope that if I keep trying I'll be able to give back to the community as much as it has given me.

## Time to get to Work!

Now it's time to actually get to work and start my new job at UpSearch!
