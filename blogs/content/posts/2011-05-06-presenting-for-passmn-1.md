May 17<sup>th</sup> I have the distinct pleasure of presenting for one of the strongest SQL Server User Groups around; [PASSMN (Minnesota SQL Server User Group)][1].

Visiting this user group has an added bonus of me being the Regional Mentor for the area.  It isn’t very often I am able to attend in person the user groups that I stay in contact with for the mentorship program.  I hope to use this to build more personal relationships with the groups.    

I will be talking about SSIS again and how we can use it to help us (DBA and Developer alike) be more efficient with our time.  The session is fun and has something to offer people starting out in SSIS and also have a solid grasp on SSIS.  I may have to go over Maintenance Plans for a refresher for Mr. English too. 

You can check out the details from the [PASSMN website][1] on times and location.  Andy Lohn (aka [@SQLQuill][2]) will be starting the meeting and talking Twitter with a knife reference in there. I wouldn’t miss that one if I were you!

I’m looking forward to this group meeting as well as the networking that comes along with it!
