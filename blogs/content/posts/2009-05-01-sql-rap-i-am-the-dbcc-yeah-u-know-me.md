So [Ward Pond][1] and [Michelle Ufford][2] started this SQL rap contest. I replied on twitter that I loved their raps and they told me &#8220;bring your skillz!&#8221;

Well I don&#8217;t think I have any skillz (in that regard) so here it goes

_Who you trying to get crazy with SA?
  
Don&#8217;t you know I&#8217;m loco&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p> 

ashes 2 ashes and dust 2 dust
  
when u fire up ur queries ur RAM goes bust

that is why u need me
  
DB check..1..2..3

I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me
  
I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me

I defrag, rebuild and help
  
Once I run there is no need to yelp

I fly under the radar, I use undocumented procs
  
When u use me, ur laid back and chillin&#8217; in ur crocs

I can show u stats and shrink ur files
  
make ur machine last longer 4 miles and miles

you can be proactive but not a bad user
  
otherwise, you will be dropped and I&#8217;ll c u in alt.total-loser

I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me
  
I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me

Once I&#8217;m done u can put ur data in the air(*)
  
Then use it like u just don&#8217;t care

Data is always there, there is a SLA
  
You know what this means, a happy SA

Da man, the Resource Governor is in da house
  
No more runaway queries, u have time 4 ur spouse

ur data is so unnormalized, it&#8217;s like a ghetto
  
You mix bits and bites diminishing your netto

I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me
  
I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me

this stuff you can&#8217;t sweep under no rug u know

* the cloud people, the cloud</em>

So that is my pathetic attempt, In my opinion the best lyrics are from It&#8217;s All About The Pentiums

**Here is the video:**
  


**Here are the lyrics**
  
&#8220;It&#8217;s All About The Pentiums&#8221;

It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby
  
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
  
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
Yeah

What y&#8217;all wanna do?
  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
  
Wastin&#8217; time with all the chatroom yakkers?
  
9 to 5, chillin&#8217; at Hewlett Packard?
  
Workin&#8217; at a desk with a dumb little placard?
  
Yeah, payin&#8217; the bills with my mad programming skills
  
Defraggin&#8217; my hard drive for thrills
  
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM
  
I never feed trolls and I don&#8217;t read spam
  
Installed a T1 line in my house
  
Always at my PC, double-clickin&#8217; on my mizouse
  
Upgrade my system at least twice a day
  
I&#8217;m strictly plug-and-play, I ain&#8217;t afraid of Y2K
  
I&#8217;m down with Bill Gates, I call him &#8220;Money&#8221; for short
  
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, what?
  
You&#8217;ve gotta be the dumbest newbie I&#8217;ve ever seen
  
You&#8217;ve got white-out all over your screen
  
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato
  
What kinda chip you got in there, a Dorito?
  
You&#8217;re usin&#8217; a 286? Don&#8217;t make me laugh
  
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
  
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette
  
You&#8217;re the biggest joke on the Internet
  
Your database is a disaster
  
You&#8217;re waxin&#8217; your modem, tryin&#8217; to make it go faster
  
Hey fella, I bet you&#8217;re still livin&#8217; in your parents&#8217; cellar
  
Downloadin&#8217; pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar
  
And postin&#8217; &#8220;Me too!&#8221; like some brain-dead AOL-er
  
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller
  
You&#8217;re just about as useless as jpegs to Hellen Keller

It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)

Now, what y&#8217;all wanna do?
  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
  
Wastin&#8217; time with all the chatroom yakkers?
  
9 to 5, chillin&#8217; at Hewlett Packard?

Uh, uh, loggin&#8217; in now
  
Wanna run wit my crew, hah?
  
Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?
  
They call me the king of the spreadsheets
  
Got &#8217;em printed out on my bedsheets
  
My new computer&#8217;s got the clocks, it rocks
  
But it was obsolete before I opened the box
  
You say you&#8217;ve had your desktop for over a week?
  
Throw that junk away, man, it&#8217;s an antique
  
Your laptop is a month old? Well that&#8217;s great
  
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight
  
My digital media is write-protected
  
Every file inspected, no viruses detected
  
I beta tested every operation system
  
Gave props to some, and others? I dissed &#8217;em
  
While your computer&#8217;s crashin&#8217;, mine&#8217;s multitaskin&#8217;
  
It does all my work without me even askin&#8217;
  
Got a flat-screen monitor forty inches wide wide
  
I believe that your says &#8220;Etch-A-Sketch&#8221; on the side
  
In a 32-bit world, you&#8217;re a 2-bit user
  
You&#8217;ve got your own newsgroup, &#8220;alt.total-loser&#8221;
  
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax
  
Where&#8217;d you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?
  
Play me online? Well, you know that I&#8217;ll beat you
  
If I ever meet you I&#8217;ll control-alt-delete you
  
What? What? What? What? What?

It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums! (It&#8217;s all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
Now, what y&#8217;all wanna do?
  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
  
Wastin&#8217; time with all the chatroom yakkers?
  
9 to 5, chillin&#8217; at Hewlett Packard?
  
What??
