So [Ward Pond][1] and [Michelle Ufford][2] started this SQL rap contest. I replied on twitter that I loved their raps and they told me “bring your skillz!”

Well I don't think I have any skillz (in that regard) so here it goes

_Who you trying to get crazy with SA?
  
Don't you know I'm loco……….</p> 

ashes 2 ashes and dust 2 dust
  
when u fire up ur queries ur RAM goes bust

that is why u need me
  
DB check..1..2..3

I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me
  
I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me

I defrag, rebuild and help
  
Once I run there is no need to yelp

I fly under the radar, I use undocumented procs
  
When u use me, ur laid back and chillin' in ur crocs

I can show u stats and shrink ur files
  
make ur machine last longer 4 miles and miles

you can be proactive but not a bad user
  
otherwise, you will be dropped and I'll c u in alt.total-loser

I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me
  
I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me

Once I'm done u can put ur data in the air(*)
  
Then use it like u just don't care

Data is always there, there is a SLA
  
You know what this means, a happy SA

Da man, the Resource Governor is in da house
  
No more runaway queries, u have time 4 ur spouse

ur data is so unnormalized, it's like a ghetto
  
You mix bits and bites diminishing your netto

I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me
  
I am the DBCC
  
yeah u know me

this stuff you can't sweep under no rug u know

* the cloud people, the cloud</em>

So that is my pathetic attempt, In my opinion the best lyrics are from It's All About The Pentiums

**Here is the video:**
  


**Here are the lyrics**
  
“It's All About The Pentiums”

It's all about the Pentiums, baby
  
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
  
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
  
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
  
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
Yeah

What y'all wanna do?
  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
  
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
  
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?
  
Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard?
  
Yeah, payin' the bills with my mad programming skills
  
Defraggin' my hard drive for thrills
  
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM
  
I never feed trolls and I don't read spam
  
Installed a T1 line in my house
  
Always at my PC, double-clickin' on my mizouse
  
Upgrade my system at least twice a day
  
I'm strictly plug-and-play, I ain't afraid of Y2K
  
I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him “Money” for short
  
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support
  
It's all about the Pentiums, what?
  
You've gotta be the dumbest newbie I've ever seen
  
You've got white-out all over your screen
  
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato
  
What kinda chip you got in there, a Dorito?
  
You're usin' a 286? Don't make me laugh
  
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
  
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette
  
You're the biggest joke on the Internet
  
Your database is a disaster
  
You're waxin' your modem, tryin' to make it go faster
  
Hey fella, I bet you're still livin' in your parents' cellar
  
Downloadin' pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar
  
And postin' “Me too!” like some brain-dead AOL-er
  
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller
  
You're just about as useless as jpegs to Hellen Keller

It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)

Now, what y'all wanna do?
  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
  
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
  
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?

Uh, uh, loggin' in now
  
Wanna run wit my crew, hah?
  
Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?
  
They call me the king of the spreadsheets
  
Got 'em printed out on my bedsheets
  
My new computer's got the clocks, it rocks
  
But it was obsolete before I opened the box
  
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?
  
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique
  
Your laptop is a month old? Well that's great
  
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight
  
My digital media is write-protected
  
Every file inspected, no viruses detected
  
I beta tested every operation system
  
Gave props to some, and others? I dissed 'em
  
While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'
  
It does all my work without me even askin'
  
Got a flat-screen monitor forty inches wide wide
  
I believe that your says “Etch-A-Sketch” on the side
  
In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user
  
You've got your own newsgroup, “alt.total-loser”
  
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax
  
Where'd you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?
  
Play me online? Well, you know that I'll beat you
  
If I ever meet you I'll control-alt-delete you
  
What? What? What? What? What?

It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
It's all about the Pentiums! (It's all about the Pentiums, baby)
  
Now, what y'all wanna do?
  
Wanna be hackers? Code crackers? Slackers
  
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
  
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?
  
What??
