  I've been notified I am a finalist for the category <em>Best New Voice</em> at the <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/blogs/2013/12/08/tribal-awards/">Tribal Awards</a>. These awards are not for some tattoos on your lower back or on your biceps, but rather a collaboration of Simple-Talk and SQLServerCentral to give outstanding community contributors the chance to receive a round of applause by their fellow peers. That's right, nomination is entirely done by the tech community itself (and I somehow seemed to miss that survey).

  I have the incredible honour to have been nominated and apparently so enough time to land me a spot in the finals. I'd appreciate it if you, dear reader, could find the time <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TribalAwardsVoting">to vote</a>. Not only for myself (my ego is already big enough), but for other excellent people as well, such as the fine SQLServerCentral forum dwellers like Gail (who needs a new custome), Paul, Jeff, Grant and others.
