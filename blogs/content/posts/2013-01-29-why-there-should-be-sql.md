On 5, 6 and 7 March 2013 Microsoft Belux is organizing [Techdays 2013][1], 3 days of sessions for IT Pro's and developers. But when checking the calendar there are no sessions about SQL Server.
  
The reason is that the [Belgian SQL Server User Group][2] organizes yearly a 2 day event about SQL Server the [SQL Server Days][3] and this is where the SQL Server enthusiasts should get their knowledge. 

<div class="image_block">

</div>

But I disagree, as a full-time SQL Server consultant, I can't justify going to an event where there is no SQL content at all. I know there are some other interesting sessions about Windows Server, SCOM, etc. but they aren't the core of my job so I can't register for this event and thus I will miss the opportunity to:

  * learn about new features in Windows server, SCOM, PowerShell...;
  * network with current and former co-workers outside the office;
  * network with other SQL Server DBA's and developers;
  * enthusiasm young developers and system administrators to learn more about SQL Server;
  * visit the partner booths, to learn what's new in the hardware world;
  * bring home a bag of goodies to make the kids happy and win some awesome prices.

And how about young, all-round system administrators and developers who can't justify a visit to Techdays AND SQL Server Days because their main focus is not on SQL Server, wouldn't they like to discover the wonderful world of SQL Server and learn:

  * how they can tame the never ending growth of the T-log;
  * the developers don't need SSMS anymore
  * SQL Server supports Server Core
  * cursors are bad for SQL Server
  * there such things as graphical execution plans
  * ...

Anyways that's my vision on the subject, feel free to agree or disagree in the comments, discussing this with me at the Techdays will probably be a no show.
