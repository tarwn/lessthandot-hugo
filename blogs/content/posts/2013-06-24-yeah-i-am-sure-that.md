Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. today announced a partnership that will enable customers to run Oracle software on Windows Server Hyper-V and in Windows Azure. Customers will be able to deploy Oracle software — including Java, Oracle Database and Oracle WebLogic Server — on Windows Server Hyper-V or in Windows Azure and receive full support from Oracle

You can read the rest of the press release here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2013/Jun13/06-24WSNewsPR.aspx

Zdnet also reported this today here: http://www.zdnet.com/oracle-databases-head-to-microsofts-hyper-v-azure-7000017226/?s_cid=e589&ttag=e589

Here is what I found interesting in that article, the following quote from Holger Mueller

> Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, said **Microsoft is addressing the shortfall of its SQL Server in terms of scalability**. Mueller added that the partnership, which doesn't mention Oracle 12c directly, is larger than expected with the additions of WebLogic and Java.

Really that is the reason, Microsoft allows running of Oracle on Azure because SQL Server has a scalibility problem? Fascinating!! What is next, Microsoft offers PHP because C# sucks?

The more plausible reason is that since Microsoft is competing directly with Amazon in the cloud, it wants to offer the same things that Amazon offers. Amazon offers Oracle as well as SQL Server.

That's what I think
