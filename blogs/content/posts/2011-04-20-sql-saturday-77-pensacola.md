As of the date this blog post is published, there are 45 days left until this year’s [SQL Saturday in Pensacola][1].  The previous Pensacola SQL Saturdays have always sounded like much more than the everyday SQL Saturday.  This was easily seen from twitter feeds and recaps posted by presenters and attendees over the last 2 years. This coming June 4<sup>th</sup>, [Pensacola is doing SQL Saturday][2] once again and I’m very excited as I’ve been picked to be part of the [scheduled presenters][3].



I will be presenting on using SSIS as a key automation tool to enhance efficiency of SQL Server Database Administration.  The presentation is always a lot of fun and sparks some thoughts on just how SSIS has little limits in benefiting DBAs as well as Developers. 

Karla Landrum ([Blog][4] | [Twitter][5]) is one of the organizers of this (and past) SQL Saturday.  She is a blast to be around and work with and I can’t wait to help out in my role as a presenter.  I think we may have even planned it so Rodney, the [ATARI tattooed Red Gate man][6], is going to get some ink the night before. 

Even if you are not a local to Pensacola, FL; this event would make a great weekend getaway for any SQL Server Professional looking for some awesome training.  Bring your family and while they sit on the beach Saturday, you can get your SQL on with all of us (in the air conditioning). 

The details for this event can be found from the links above.  When you register, don’t forget to put in your networking information so you are listed for all the other SQL Server Professionals on the [networking page][7].  These events are much more than training and networking has great power in your career and building your skills. 

The Friday before the SQL Saturday event, June 3<sup>rd</sup>, there are also two Pre-Con events scheduled.  Friend and fellow MVP, Andy Leonard ([Blog][8] | [Twitter][9]) is bringing his amazing abilities in SSIS to you with, “[Learning SQL Server Integration Services][10]”.  I highly recommend this Pre-Con.  The cost is unbelievably low for what you will take away from a teacher such as Andy is.  MVP Kevin Wolf is also doing a Pre-Con, “Real World Windows Phone 7 Development”.  Being a consultant and seeing the mobile age moving forward so rapidly, this Pre-Con sounds greatly beneficial to any professional that will have a hand in present and future mobile projects.

Thanks to SQL Saturday in Pensacola for allowing me to the opportunity to come down and present as well as be a part of this event.  We are going to have a great time and I encourage you to invade Pensacola from all areas the weekend of June 4<sup>th</sup> for some free SQL training.
