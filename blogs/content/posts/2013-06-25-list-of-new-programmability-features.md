What, there is nothing there? That is right, besides the Hekaton related stuff there seems to be almost nothing. Some people seems upset about this, I think we will get new programmability features and T-SQL enhancements in the next SQl Server 2014 CTP. I believe that Microsoft wanted to make sure that people really checked out the Hekaton technology instead of focusing on other things as well

What do you think, are you excited for Hekaton or are you waiting for new programmability features and T-SQL enhancements?

Here is the Books On Line link with ALL the new stuff http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510411(v=sql.120).aspx

BTW, I do have some posts about SQL Server 2014 CTP1, the small list is below
