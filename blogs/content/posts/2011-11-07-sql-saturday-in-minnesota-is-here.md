[<img style="float: left;" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/-62.png?mtime=1319638751" alt="" width="236" height="115" />SQL Saturday in Minnesota][1] is upon us.  Only a few more days and I'll be heading to Minnesota and have a chance to hang out with many of my good friends as well as meet hundreds of other SQL Server professionals.  Last year I wasn't able to make this event due to a change in jobs.  This year, I'm happy to not only be making the event but see my current employers, Magenic Technologies, on the sponsor list.

Magenic has turned into a great home for me and a company that is respected as well as known for having some of the most skilled people in the profession.  I'm looking forward to being able to catch up with the Minnesota area co-workers just as much as the event itself.

Good friend, Steve Hughes ([Blog][2] | [Twitter][3]), asked me today if I would be interested in moderating the "SQL Community and Social Networking – Roundtable" session also.  There was little chance to me turning this opportunity down.  The members of the community that will be on this panel are, to say the least, brilliant minds in the SQL Community.  I'm looking forward to giving them all my best heckling as a moderator.

The session is being held at 9:45 AM and in the Professional Development track.  I think this track is a great idea and may have to see if using the same concept for future SQL Saturday I help organize is a possibility.

This panel session description is below and also can be seen on the [Event Schedule][4] on the SQL Saturday web site.

**SQL Community and Social Networking -Roundtable** 

This session will be an open discussion on the various types of community involvement such as user groups, professional organizations, and events along with social networking such as Twitter and blogs. We will discuss how to get started, usage etiquette, and career impact related to these topics. Plan on a lively discussion. Panelists are: Andy Lohn, Dan English, Jason Strate, and Steve Hughes.

I would highly recommend attending this session if you can.  In terms of professional development, the community and social networking are paramount.  I know it has been for me personally and I can't wait to share those experiences and be part of the panel group.

Please remember, if you registered for this event and are not able to attend, use the site or contact an organizer to let them know.  The event is full and that means a waiting list is in effect.  As an organizer of many SQL Saturdays, I know firsthand how rough it is to turn people away that can attend.

See you Friday!!!
