In continuing Chrissie's recent example of helping to point out minor (yet critical) gotchas, I now present the guarantor of a few Null Reference exceptions, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb513985.aspx" title="MSDN entry for the IF Operator" target="_blank">If()</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualbasic.interaction.iif.aspx" title="MSDN entry for the IIF Function" target="_blank">IIf()</a>.

Both are designed as a way to provide VB.Net with an inline If, similar to the ternary operator found in C# and many other languages <code class="codespan"><condition>?<true-action>:<false-action></code>. If() and IIF() have the same signature: <code class="codespan">If(<conditional>,<true-object>,<false-object>)</code> and <code class="codespan">IIF(<conditional>,<true-object>,<false-object>)</code>

The critical difference between IIF (available from VS 2002 forward) and IF (available in VS 2005 forward) is that IIF is a function and evaluates all of its arguments prior to returning a value, while IF is an operator that executes like a short-circuiting conditional, only evaluating the true or false argument depending on the value of the conditional. 

Why is this important?

```vb.net
Dim myObject as SomeObject

Dim strTestOne = If(myObject Is Nothing,"Doesn't Exist",myObject.SomeProperty())

' strTestOne now has the value "Doesn't Exist"

Dim strTestTwo = IIf(myObject Is Nothing,"Doesn't Exist",myObject.SomeProperty())

' and this one throws a null reference because it evaluates myObject.SomeProperty prior to the conditional
```
So make sure you select the right function for your needs. In this case, selecting the wrong function can actually have the exact consequence you were trying to avoid (Null Ref).
