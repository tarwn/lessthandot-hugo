This is day twenty-four of the [SQL Advent 2012 series][1] of blog posts. Today we are going to look at how to get help.

[<img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7068/7089908693_f5cb6d839a_m.jpg" width="240" height="125" alt="Help!" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" />][2]Imagine if you were stuck with some problem in 1995, you didn&#8217;t have that many choices, you could ask the resident _know it all_ at your job, you could lookup stuff in a book or you could go on the newsgroups and try to get help that way. These days there are many more ways to get help. There are many more books than in 1995, there are also a lot more whitepapers available these days. Twitter is a great way to get help as well if you use a special hashtag. Attend one of the many [SQL Saturday][3] events, there are always experts available who are willing to help you out with your problems. These events are held all over the world and there is a good chance one will be held near your town as well.

**Forums/QA sites**
  
Join a QA site like [stackoverflow][4], head on to a specialized site on stackexchange, here is a list of all of them http://stackexchange.com/sites You can hit some of the [forums][5] on this site. For SQL server, you can also try [SQLServerCentral][6]

**Twitter**
  
Don&#8217;t be scared to ask for help on twitter, if you don&#8217;t know any of the SQL Server tweeple, use the #sqlhelp hash tag and ask for help, here is an example of what it looks like [#sqlhelp][7]
  
Here is an image of the replies on twitter after I asked a question with the #sqlhelp tag
