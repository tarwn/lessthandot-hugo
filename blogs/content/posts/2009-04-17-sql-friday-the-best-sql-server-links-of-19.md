Time for another episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show.
  
Here is what I found interesting this past week in SQL Land:

**[Backup Log with Truncate_Only][1]**
  
Brent Ozar (without Hulk hands) explains in a video why backup log with truncate_only is a dangerous command with serious consequences. Learn why this might not be the best way to free up drive space on your SQL Server.

**[does size really matter &#8211; or is it what you do with it?][2]**
  
Paul Randal has a survey on his website: &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in the physical layout of your databases. I&#8217;ve got four surveys, for a variety of database sizes. Please vote multiple times in each survey, as you see fit&#8221;

**[How Dirty are your Reads?][3]**
  
Andrew Kelly asks: &#8220;are dirty reads overused or even abused” by the average shop these days?&#8221;

**[Requirements vs Architecture][4]**
  
Louis Davidson has a nice post, he asks: &#8220;Can you turn off the “Get ‘er done” part of your mind when you are doing requirements, or do you find that you really really want to start building software well before you really understand the entire problem?&#8221;

**[SQL Server 2008 SP1 Cumulative Update 1 is available!][5]**
  
Aaron Bertrand tells us that if you were among those who installed CU4 for SQL Server 2008, then installed SP1, you may not know that you lost some of the fixes that came with CU4

**[Developers vs DBAs][6]**
  
Gail writes: &#8220;I was listening to a podcast on nHibernate this morning. Most of it was very good, but there was one section that absolutly made me see red.

The guest on the show was asked how the DBAs felt about the use of nHibernate for a new app on an existing (old) database. The reply essentially was &#8216;We haven&#8217;t told them and we’re not going to tell them.'&#8221;



That is it for this week, I will tag the weekly posts with **SQL Friday** in case you want to see the whole archive in the future
