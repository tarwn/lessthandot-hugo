Here we are with another fascinating episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show. I can't believe it is week 10 already, if I continue like this I will be retired soon.....or just tired without the re prefix.
  
Here is what I found interesting this past week in SQL Land:

**[Shrinking is a popular topic...][1]**
  
Mike explains some concepts about shrinking and the transaction log

**[String comparison: binary vs. dictionary][2]**
  
Linchi Shea writes: t is well known that you get better performance if you compare two strings in a binary collation than in a dictionary collation. But is the performance difference significant enough to warrant the use of an explicit COLLATE clause in the string comparison expression?

**[Get a Quick Review of SQL Server Information][3]**
  
Allen White shows us how you can use PowerShell and SMO to get some information about your SQL Servers

**[Much ado about logins and SIDs][4]**
  
Greg Low explains what you have to do to SQL Server logins that need to be moved between servers

**[Back To Basics: Clustered vs NonClustered Indexes; what's the difference?][5]**
  
Denny Cherry highlights some differences between Clustered and NonClustered Indexes

**[What the heck is a SQL Server HOBT, anyway?][6]**
  
Aaron Alton explains what a HOBT aka Heap Or B-Tree is, so we are not talking about hobbits

**[T-SQL Bitwise Operations][7]**
  
Having written about this myself a while back here: http://sqlblog.com/blogs/denis_gobo/archive/2007/05/29/test.aspx
  
It was nice to see that Michelle Ufford did a nice job of explaining Bitwise Operations in T-SQL

**[Some Simple Code To Show The Difference Between Newid And Newsequentialid][8]**
  
Someone who thinks he is me ðŸ™‚ wrote a post showing why NEWID() is Evil

**[Index columns, selectivity and inequality predicates][9]**
  
Gail Shaw shows us how how selectivity and index column order affect inequality predicates.



That is it for this week, I will tag the weekly posts with **SQL Friday** in case you want to see the whole archive in the future
