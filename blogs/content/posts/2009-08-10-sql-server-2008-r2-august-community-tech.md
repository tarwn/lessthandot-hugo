Microsoft has just announced the release of the August Community Technology Preview (CTP) of SQL Server 2008 R2. You might have heard about this before when people talked about _Kilimanjaro_ and _Project Gemini_.

Why should you download the CTP?

  * Explore the enhanced database management capabilities in SQL Server Management Studio.
  * Preview SQL Server StreamInsight, Microsoft’s new complex event processing technology
  * Be the first in your organization to run SQL Server on more than 64 processor cores.
  * Provide early feedback to the development team.

The Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 August Community Technology Preview (CTP)
  
includes Application and Multi-server Management which will help
  
organizations manage database environments efficiently at scale with
  
increased visibility and control across the application lifecycle. Also
  
included is Report Builder 3.0 with support for geospatial visualization
  
(mapping, routing, custom shapes) which can help produce new insights and
  
discoveries well beyond what can be achieved with standard tables and charts
  
when geospatial data is combined with business information. Microsoft® SQL
  
Server® StreamInsight will also be made available for Community Technology
  
Preview in the coming weeks. This new complex event processing technology
  
will help businesses derive better insights by correlating event streams
  
from multiple sources with near-zero latency.

Make sure to check out the [SQL Server 2008 R2 Books Online (August CTP)][3] which has information what is new in this release.

According to [SQL Server 2008 R2 Books Online (August CTP)][4]

> Creating a SQL Server utility control point (UCP): Install a single instance of the SQL Server 2008 R2 Database Engine and then promote it to be the UCP. The UCP is the central repository for configuration and performance data collected for all the instances enrolled in the SQL Server Utility. The UCP is the central reasoning point for the SQL Server Utility. It supports actions such as applying central policies, or analyzing resource utilization trends of an instance to predict when it might exceed central resource utilization polices.

You can find more info in the link above about:

  * Overview of SQL Server Utility.
  * How to: Create a SQL Server Utility Control Point (SQL Server Utility).
  * How to: Enroll an Instance of SQL Server (SQL Server Utility).
  * Monitoring Instances of SQL Server in the SQL Server Utility.

Also mentioned is Data-Tier Application

**Data-Tier Application**
  
A data-tier application (DAC) simplifies the development, deployment, and management of the data-tier objects that support a multi-tier or client-server application. A DAC defines all of the Database Engine schema and instance objects, such as tables, views, and logins, required to support the application. The DAC operates as a single unit of management through the development, deployment, and management lifecycle of the associated application. The DAC also contains policies that define the deployment prerequisites for the DAC.
