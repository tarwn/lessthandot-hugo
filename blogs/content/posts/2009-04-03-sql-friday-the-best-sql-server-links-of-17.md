Time for another episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show.
  
I skipped last week because of some mysterious reason. Here is what I found interesting this past week in SQL Land:

**[The death of datetime?][1]**
  
Bart Duncan explains why you should almost always use DateTimeOffset instead of Datetime

**[Who is Active? v8.40 &#8211; Now With Delta Power!][2]**
  
Adam Machanic has updated his Who is Active with a huge number of changes, fixes, and enhancements

**[SQL Server DBA Interview: Kendal Van Dyke][3]**
  
Brent Ozar interviews Kendal Van Dyke about SQL, RAID, Blogging etc

**[SQLDumper unable to generate mdmp files in SQL Server 2008 Failover clusters][4]**
  
SQLDumper utility is used by various components of the product to generate and save diagnostic information in the form of mini-dump and other log files. You will normally find the output files [with extension .mdmp, .txt and .log] created by sqldumper.exe in the LOG folder of the specific instance for the Database Engine.
  
If you have SQL Server 2008 failover cluster installations you might be having a problem that prevents these important files from getting created 

**[SQL Server Technical Rollup &#8211; Lots of Useful Documents, News, Events and New KB articles][5]**
  
Tony Rogerson has compiled a nice list of useful documents, news, events and new KB articles



That is it for this week, I will tag the weekly posts with **SQL Friday** in case you want to see the whole archive in the future
