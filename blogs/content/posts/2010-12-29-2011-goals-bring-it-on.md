I know I&#8217;ve said it before, but 2010 was an amazing year. I can&#8217;t wait to see what 2011 has in store for me. 

A year ago, I sat down and wrote some goals for myself. I achieved almost all of them, and they opened doors for me that have led to opportunities I would never have imagined. I&#8217;ve spent the last few weeks thinking about what I can ask myself to do next year. I want to continue working on the amazing opportunities I&#8217;ve been given, try some new things, and (most importantly) inspire and help others to do cool stuff too. 

**Professional Goals**

**Blogging:**   
Continue to blog. I&#8217;m not going to set a specific goal for a number of posts. I felt I failed last year when I did that. I want to put up some great, high-quality blog posts here. I&#8217;ve been keeping a list of things I&#8217;m interested in blogging about, so that when I have some time, I can sit down and write. 

**Presenting:**   
2011 is my year to jump into the deep end of the pool. Goals:  
3 user groups   
3 SQL Saturdays   
1 other event   
Dates are already set for presenting to the [WI SSUG][1] (February) and [MADPASS][2] (April). Maybe a Chicago-area SSUG will ask me to drive down?   
I&#8217;ve submitted sessions for [SQL Saturday #67 Chicago][3]. I plan to submit to East Iowa. That leaves one more for the year, at least.   
I&#8217;d love to have another forum to present in. Perhaps it will be 24 Hours of PASS, and perhaps it will be something else. 

**Attend PASS Summit:**  
This is the year I go and take PASS Summit by storm. The last two years, I had asked (and counted on) my employer to send me. I realized that isn&#8217;t a given, so this year I&#8217;m paying my own way. I will volunteer, beg, and save my pennies to be able to go. 

**Support Cool Community Projects:**  
The SQL community is full of SQL People with amazing ideas. I&#8217;ve been honored to be asked to participate in a couple of them. I&#8217;ll be a [SQL University][4] professor, be a [SQL Person][5], storm the internets for the [SQL Denali News Team][6], and help the [PASS WIT chapter][7]. I can&#8217;t wait to see what other ideas are born this year. 

On that topic, my goal is also to say &#8220;**no**&#8221; this year. It is fun and exciting to be asked to help with a project. However, one person can&#8217;t do everything, and I am beginning to understand this. If I am asked to help with something, and I don&#8217;t have the time for it or interest in it, I will politely decline. This will be a big step for me, because I hate saying no. 

**Help Others:**  
Nothing is more exciting to me than to help someone else realize a goal. Whether I am editing a blog post or reviewing a resume, answering questions about Twitter or connecting two people who have a common goal, I love to help. 

**Help Myself:**  
All of those seem very soft-skill, community-oriented goals. I don&#8217;t want to pick any hard-and-fast goals for myself, like &#8220;be the master of such-and-such feature or technology.&#8221; I do, however, need to increase my technical knowledge, of SQL Server and beyond. I want to get two certifications this year. I&#8217;m currently studying for the 70-432, and take the exam January 24. I want to get a second certification later in the year. I&#8217;m also going to write a PowerShell script. I really am, I promise, Aaron. 

**Personal Goals  
**   
**Running:**  
Dear running shoes, I have big plans for you this year. HUGE! I want to: run my four favorite 5Ks (Soul Burner, Cross Country, St. Joe&#8217;s, and Race for the Light), run two (yes, TWO) half marathons, conquer the Warrior Dash, and put 500 miles on my shoes in 2011. 

Five hundred miles. Sounds like a lot, doesn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s less than two miles a day. It&#8217;s only ten miles a week. I may need new shoes halfway through the year, but it will be worth it. 

I recently discovered snowshoeing, and have fallen in love. I want to get a few miles on those this winter. I also want to build up my hiking this summer, and do a 10-mile hike by September. 

**In The Kitchen:**   
Provided I don&#8217;t end up in the emergency room because of a cut or a burn, I can&#8217;t wait to make more messes in the kitchen this year. Now that I&#8217;ve conquered Hollandaise, maybe I&#8217;ll work my way up to Bernaise, or cook a whole turkey. (I may need people to help me eat it, though.) This is also the year I volunteer for [Men Who Cook][8], a fundraiser to benefit Christine Ann Domestic Abuse Services. 

**Reading:**  
At heart, I&#8217;m a bookworm. I didn&#8217;t read nearly as much as I wanted to in 2010, because I got wrapped up in other things. I&#8217;m going to make a point to read at least two non-technical books a month this year. I have quite the stack on my bookshelf already waiting for me, so this should be easy.

There are a few other things, too, like being an active member of the Oshkosh Jaycees, and skydiving for my 30th birthday.

So, 2011: bring it on. I can&#8217;t wait.
