This month's PASSMN User Group meeting will be held on Tuesday, February 17th at 4PM at the <a href="http://binged.it/AcUxYj" target="_blank">Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) in Edina</a>. This meeting is being sponsored by our friends at <a href="https://pragmaticworks.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Works</a>. A huge thanks to PW for their generous sponsorship!

PASSMN is excited to open the monthly meeting with a short talk fromÂ Tony Malarz on using Ola Hallengren's scripts.

> **Ola Hallengren Scripts**
> 
> **Abstract:** The Ola Hallengren scripts cover backups, index and stats maintenance, and checkdb. This will also include an explanation of how Tony has integrated the suite into the maintenance routines at multiple sites, plus the use cases for when the suite is (and maybe isn't) a good fit. And it fits into any budget: it's free!
> 
> **About Tony Malarz:** Tony is a SQL Server DBA with 19 years experience in data management and development, dev group management, infrastructure, ERP, and compliance. He has kept the data flowing in industries ranging from collectibles to biofuels, groceries to HVAC. 

The featured presentation for the evening will be from the owner of <a href="https://pragmaticworks.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Works</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianknight" target="_blank">Brian Knight</a> (<a href="http://blog.pragmaticworks.com/author/brian-knight" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/brianknight" target="_blank">Twitter</a>). Brian spoke to a capacity crows at PASSMN two years ago and we expect another full house on the 17th!

> **Creating Actionable Intelligence with Power Query**
> 
> **Abstract:** Learn how to make BI really work for you with Power Query in Excel. In this session, you'll see how to make business intelligence truly actionable for your end users by mashing data together that might seem unrelated at first. You'll find out how to use the Power Query platform to take data from tables in websites and mash it with data in proper relational databases. Then, see how to present the data to end users with Power BI.
