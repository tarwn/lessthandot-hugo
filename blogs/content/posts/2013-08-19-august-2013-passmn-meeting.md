The August 2013 <a href="http://minnesota.sqlpass.org" target="_blank">PASSMN</a> is going to be another outstanding event! If you are in the Twin Cities area this coming Tuesday, August 20th, you'll want to make sure you have this is on your calendar.

PASSMN is excited to welcome Minnesota and <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/" target="_blank">SQLSkills</a>' own, Joseph Sack (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/joe/" target="_blank">Blog</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/josephsack" target="_blank">Twitter</a>)!

Before his time with <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/" target="_blank">SQLSkills</a>, Joe worked for Microsoft as a Premier Field Engineer and managed the SQL Server MCM program. We are extremely excited to have Joe speaking this month and are expecting another overflow crowd!

> **Performance Issues and Patterns – Joseph Sack**
> 
> **Abstract:** While a SQL Server professional may encounter various one-off situations over the course of a career, there are also several shared patterns and scenarios. In this session we'll walk through a few of these patterns interactively – where I'll reproduce the issue and we'll work through the scenario until we get to the root cause.
> 
> **About Joe:** Joe Sack is a Principal Consultant with SQLskills. He has worked as a SQL Server professional since 1997 and has supported and developed for SQL Server environments in financial services, IT consulting, manufacturing, retail and the real estate industry.

He was responsible for providing deep SQL Server advisory services, training, troubleshooting and ongoing solutions guidance.
