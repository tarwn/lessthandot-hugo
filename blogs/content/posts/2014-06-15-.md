Personal development is a pretty big deal. I doubt many of us would choose the doctor that hadn&#8217;t advanced their skills in the past 30 years over the one that kept his skills up to date through reading the right periodicals, practice, etc. Ditto for the teacher using a 20 year lesson plan, and engineer who only uses 20 year or greater materials, etc.

## It&#8217;s on you

A bit of a side trip, but your development is on you.

Many companies don&#8217;t train their employees or provide outside training. They somehow expect that when a developer runs into a new problem, they will be able to make a snap decision about a series of tools they have no experience with, that will properly take into account capability, risk, opportunity costs, and the limitations the tool will impose on the product and company. 

A smaller set do send their developers off to training, relying on the 3-5 day certification classes that typically focus on teaching to a test instead of providing foundation for learning and using a technology. The goal for these companies, though, is often to be able to check the box &#8220;we offer training&#8221; but, more importantly, to be able to keep the XYZ Vendor Partner logo on their website.

The last set actively train their developers, possibly even helping them build career and professional development plans. Many of us got into software development, databases, operations, etc because we really enjoyed it. We want to learn more about it. We want to have time to fiddle with new things in a real environment. We&#8217;re makers and doers. Receiving assistance, motivation, goals, training, and resources to improve ourselves (as well as just play with cool stuff) makes us happy and motivated, makes it more fun to work at the company with those happy and motivated people, provides options that people have already tried when a new tool is needed, and ends in higher productivity. We&#8217;re happier, the company is happier, everyone gets more done. Or at least that&#8217;s my theory and why I&#8217;m working on this for my team right now (and [I&#8217;m hiring][1], if you&#8217;re interested).

But even if you are in the last group, you need to take an active role in your development. In the first two, you have no choice but to either take an active role or fall into a rut, losing your edge and skills you use infrequently.

## Plan your Stay-At-Home Mini-Conference Topic

I&#8217;m not going to get into building your personal plan or career goals right now, that&#8217;s for another time. Today we&#8217;re going to talk about how you can set one day aside and make a huge step forward. What we&#8217;re going to do is plan a mini-conference, just for you.

First we need to answer some questions:

1) What areas do you need to brush up on or catch up on?

The best option here is to take 10-20 minutes to brainstorm all the tools, skills, and technologies that you use but know you are behind on, places you want to go deeper, and new things you have heard about that you always wanted your company to give you a chance to try. Is there any common themes among them that draw you the most? Can you boil it down to just one or two words or technology names? Excellent, write that down.

2) Do you have the tools available to try the things you selected in #1? If not, it may be a good idea to go back to that step and revise it or pick a different topic for your first ever mini-conference.

3) What [learning styles][2] work best for you? I know that I personally learn well from reading, doing, and visual. Take a few minutes to think through examples of when you learned the most, what styles were involved? 

4) Who do you want to be when you grow up? (Answer: you, but more awesome) Oops, I gave you that one. You may like or dislike what you do for a job right now, but if you have read this far, there are aspects of what you do that you love and there are skills and motivation just under the surface that probably just need a workout (and with enough work, will lead to a job you will take pride in). Take a moment to write down some of the things you will be able to do more often if your skills were stronger, if you had more experience with the technologies or skills in #1, of the types of fun projects you could work on with enough of that skill, of the type of improvements you would make to your current job or environment if you had the option to, of past successes that you could have made even better had you had these skills. 

5) Can you set aside one day (probably on the weekend) to do this? Not 1 day a week, 1 day a month, or anything else, just 1 single day. It&#8217;s often hard to think about starting any kind of workout routine, personal development effort, class, etc because it&#8217;s so much time out of every week or month. Forget all of that, let&#8217;s just set aside one day to take a jump forward, then we can talk again after that.

6) Name it (I&#8217;m serious). Incorporate your name, your city, your technology choice, anything. You&#8217;re making something, give it a name.

Ok, so we know what we&#8217;re going to work on, we know which learning styles work the best for us, we know why we&#8217;re going to work on it, we know when we&#8217;re going to do it, and we have a name for it, now we can plan it.

## Plan Your Stay-At-Home Mini-Conference

This is the trickiest part, because I can tell you how to build my mini-conference that works for my learning styles and interests, but that won&#8217;t necessarily work for yours. So let&#8217;s start simple.

First we&#8217;re going to create a schedule, it can be as loose or exact as you want. if you are going to have a loose schedule, then I&#8217;d suggest having a firm goal that you are absolutely going to reach over the course of the day to keep it from getting sidetracked.

Next, peruse the list of video offerings below (or ask in the comments if you need some options beyond these). Pick out videos that are relevant to your topic plus one or two that are on personal development, career development, or by speakers you always wanted to see in person. 

From here, we are going to whittle the video collection down to 4-5 videos. Pick 2 videos for the morning and 2 for the afternoon. Pick one of the unrelated videos I had you select as your keynote. 

So now we should have something like this:

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MiniConference1.png" alt="Rough Conference Schedule" width="564" height="298" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2741" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MiniConference1.png 564w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MiniConference1-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" />][3]

Because I learn well from doing, I am now going to intermix blocks of time in between the videos for actually doing the things they are talking about. As I watch each video, I will choose to either pause the video every few minutes and follow along on my own locally, or I will choose to watch all the way through and then spend an hour working with what they showed me. This workshop gives me the chance to mix what I have watched with doing the thing as well as, inevitably, some reading when I try to find some blog posts to help me out.

Now my schedule looks something like this:

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MiniConference2.png" alt="Finished Conference Schedule" width="655" height="349" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2742" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MiniConference2.png 655w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/MiniConference2-300x159.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" />][4]

The last thing is to pick one or two alternative videos. most of these videos will have votes and comments on you to tell you whether they were good or not, but on the off-chance that one of them does bomb, make sure you have an alternative lined up that you can &#8216;attend&#8217; instead.

At this point, all that is left is setting aside the time and doing it. If you have a blog, now is the perfect time to write a post about your upcoming conference and what you&#8217;re looking forward to learning, this provides additional reinforcement and motivation and might even draw in some others that want virtually attend your Mini-Conference from their own homes.

## Attending your Stay-At-Home Mini-Conference

Now comes the fun part, attending your Stay-At-Home Mini-Conference.

Before you start, get a notebook or create an empty text file. As you watch the videos, do workshops, etc, write reviews of each one, just as if you were there in person. Make sure you note the most important points you learn in each one, questions, and topics the speakers mention that you want to dig into later.

Enjoy your conference.
