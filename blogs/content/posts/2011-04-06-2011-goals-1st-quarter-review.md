It's that time of the year again: quarterly goal review. My [2011 Goals][1] were set very high. I had an amazing 2010, and want this year to be even better. 

How have I been doing? I've been busy. I decided to tackle several major projects at the same time. I'm happy to say most of them succeeded, and I had a great time and learned a lot. However, I need to slow down a little bit so I don't burn myself out. 

**Blogging:**
  
I've written 17 posts, but only 6 I would consider technical. I've been writing a lot about community and events.
  
Status: meh.
  
I have lots of ideas. I just need the time to write. And, I need to focus on more technical posts. 

**Presenting:**
  
I am blown away by my experiences presenting already this year.
  
February – presented "Reporting Services 201" for WI SSUG.
  
March – presented "Reporting Services 201" for 24 Hours of PASS and "Make Your Voice Heard" for SQL Saturday 67 Chicago.
  
I will be the speaker for MADPASS in April. I'm considering submitting for SQL Saturday 75 Columbus. I'm trying to work out a date to present to ONSSUG. I have committed to submitting abstracts for PASS Summit.
  
Status: 1/3 UGs, 1/3 SQL Saturdays, 24HOP. Bring it on. I love this. 

**Attend PASS Summit:**
  
Registered, and ready to go.
  
Status: Seattle, you better get ready for me. 

**Support Cool Community Projects:**
  
I'm on the board for [MADPASS][2] and [PASS WIT][3]. I was a professor for [SQL University][4] SSRS week and WIT week. I hosted [T-SQL Tuesday][5]. I have other projects coming up.
  
I'm still working on "no", though. I have to get better at that. While a fun month, March didn't leave me much time for sleep or my friends.
  
Status: the SQL community is awesome. I'm excited to be part of it, every day. 

**Help Others:**
  
I hope I'm doing this, every day. 

**Help Myself:**
  
I [failed my certification exam][6], but I learned a lot from it. I'm thinking of rescheduling for sometime in the summer. 

**Running:**
  
I love running with every fiber of my being. I've run one 5K already this year, and next weekend I run my very first half marathon. I'm at over 150 miles for the year already.
  
Status: in love. 

**Summary** 

The first quarter of the year has been excellent. I'm settling into my new job (it's officially been six months), I'm getting better at writing, and I enjoy presenting. In the next quarter, I have more presentations and events planned, which I'm looking forward to. 

How are you progressing on your goals for the year?
