![T-SQL Tuesday][1]
  
One day, Adam Machanic ([Twitter][2] | [Blog][3]) had the most brilliant idea of his life to that point: [T-SQL Tuesday][4]. (That _may_ be a slight exaggeration.) This is &#8220;a recurring, revolving blog party&#8221;, hosted by a guest blogger on the second Tuesday of each month. We&#8217;ve had [15 fantastic parties so far][5]. I am lucky enough to host T-SQL Tuesday #016 on **March, 8, 2011**! 

**The Topic: Aggregation**

No, not aggravation (although I&#8217;ve used the two interchangably before). I want to hear how you solved business problems with aggregate functions. I want to see your cool T-SQL tricks. How are aggregates used in SSRS, SSAS, or SSIS? What have you learned about aggregate functions? 

Let&#8217;s SUM(thoughts), COUNT(ways we&#8217;ve done things), and set MAX(awesome) on our posts! 

Remember: &#8220;any post that is related to both SQL Server and the theme is fair game. So feel free to post about SSIS, SSRS, Java integration, or whatever other technologies you&#8217;re working with in conjunction with SQL Server. Even if your post includes no T-SQL we still want to see it.&#8221; 

**The Rules** 

The first rule of T-SQL Tuesday is: talk about T-SQL Tuesday! 

  * Post your blog between 00:00 GMT Tuesday, March 8 and 00:00 GMT Wednesday, March 9. (This is equivalent to 8:00 PM EST Monday, March 7 and 8:00 PM EST Tuesday, March 8.) 
  * Come back here and leave a comment or a pingback to your post. 
  * In the body of the blog, you must include the T-SQL Tuesday logo, with a link back to this blog. (Sample HTML: <code class="codespan">&lt;a href:"/index.php/DataMgmt/DBProgramming/come-one-come-all-to"&gt;&lt;img src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/olap_1.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> ) 

**Bonus Points** 

  * In the post title, include &#8220;T-SQL Tuesday #016&#8221;. 
  * Tweet your blog post with the hash tag #tsql2sday. 
  * Consider hosting in the future, and contact Adam if you&#8217;re interested. 

I&#8217;ll be reading through all the blog posts and posting a round-up. I can&#8217;t wait to read your thoughts!
