My friend Jacob Sebastian runs a very interesting [T-SQL quiz][1] this month and everyone is encouraged to take part in it and have a chance to win a prize.

I participated in the very first SQL quiz a few months ago. I can say that I learn a lot when I was trying to answer hard questions and doing a research. This time I am participating as a Quiz Master. [My question][2] is now open for all answerers.

I invite all my friends to participate in the quiz and increase their knowledge.

Good luck to all of you!
