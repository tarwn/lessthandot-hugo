Microsoft announced pricing for Azure.

Today, during the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference 2009 Microsoft announced the business and partner model for the Windows Azure platform including service level agreements and support programs.

Windows Azure, SQL Azure and .NET Services will be commercially available at the Professional Developer Conference 2009 and Microsoft hopes you will continue building on the Community Technology Preview (CTP) at no cost today. 

Upon commercial availability Microsoft will offer Windows Azure through a consumption-based pricing model, allowing partners and customers to pay only for the services that they consume.

**Windows Azure:**
   
Compute @ $0.12 / hour
   
Storage @ $0.15 / GB stored
   
Storage Transactions @ $0.01 / 10K

**SQL Azure:**
   
Web Edition – Up to 1 GB relational database @ $9.99
   
Business Edition – Up to 10 GB relational database @ $99.99 

**.NET Services:**
   
Messages @ $0.15/100K message operations , including Service Bus messages and Access Control tokens

Bandwidth across all three services will be charged at $0.10 in / $0.15 out / GB
