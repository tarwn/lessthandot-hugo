[Tech on Tap v1.3 PowerShell][1] was held on October 13. This was our third and final event for the year, and it was every bit as great as the first two.

### PowerShell

The focus of this event was PowerShell. What is it? How can I use it? What do I need to know to get started? We got an overview of Powershell from Brian Lewis of Microsoft. Then Steve Murawski, PowerShell MVP, gave us practical everyday examples and scripts. Adam Driscoll from Quest showed off Powershell 3.0, which has some really neat enhancements.

### We Do It For the Attendees

This event is held for the attendees. We want to increase their knowledge, we want to give them the opportunity to ask questions, and we want them to network with other IT professionals in the area. It was heartening to see people that were in attendance for the third event in a row, many attending for the second time, and even a few new faces! The event has attracted people from Green Bay to Milwaukee and Madison to Sheboygan.

The best part of this event continues to be the range of people that attend. There are programmers, administrators, managers, Linux, Windows, SQL, and more represented and talked about. This cross-discipline audience was exactly our goal, and leads to many interesting viewpoints and discussions. It is one of the results I am proudest of.

### Stone Cellar Brewpub

[Stone Cellar][2] continues to be an outstanding host for the event. The staff is friendly and goes above and beyond to serve us. The food is delicious and the beer is even better. This time, we had Vanishing Vanilla Stout, Pie Eyed India Pale Ale, and Stonetoberfest. That was my favorite beer of the day until tasting time, when the Pumpkin Spice Ale was brought out. YUM. Some of that now resides in my fridge.

### Thank You

Thank you to my fellow brewmasters, Derek and Mark. We are a team, and we make a great team. This event wouldn’t happen without you. Thank you to the many people who helped spread the word through email, blogging, and Twitter. Thank you for supporting and believing in us. And thank you to everyone that attended – we do this for you, and hope you gain many things from it!

### Tech on Tap v2.1

We’re ready to roll for our second year! Our first event in 2013 will be on Saturday, February 2 – please plan to join us!
