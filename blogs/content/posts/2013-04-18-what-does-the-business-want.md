During a conversation with fellow blogger chrissie1 last year (yes, I&#8217;m really behind on this), the topic of technology and ROI (return on investment) and how IT integrates with business came up. It&#8217;s an interesting subject and something that is likely to generate debate between techies and (not-techie) business folks. But it is something that often seems to create a wide gulf between the two aforementioned groups.

Business often sees its needs as paramount and utilizes technology as a part of its process and model. But technology is only a means to an end as far as the business is concerned, it is not the end itself. Even for IT companies, the technology itself is not so much the end game as it is to produce software that other companies are willing to purchase and utilize. Yet there is often a visible disconnect between what the business thinks it needs from the IT groups and what the IT groups think the business needs or can use.

I have been on Â both sides of this discussion and I believe much of the disconnect emanates from a communications breakdown. The end game really remains the same for both sides of this equation &#8211; efficiency. The business wants technical solutions that will help it to streamline its process in producing its end product and relies on the technical team to provide that solution. However, trying to explain exactly what is needed to those techies often becomes problematic.
