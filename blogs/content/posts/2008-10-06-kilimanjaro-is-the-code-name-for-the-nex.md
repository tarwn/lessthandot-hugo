So after Shiloh, Sphinx, Yukon and Katmai now we have Kilimanjaro. Kilimanjaro is a mountain in Tanzania and the new codename for SQL Server 11 🙂

[Edit]Apparently Kilimanjaro is the code name for the next version of SQL Server but this is not SQL 11 🙁

Here is what it says in the press release

Ted Kummert, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s Data and Platform Storage Division, showcased “Kilimanjaro,” which will further enrich SQL Server’s BI capabilities while providing a robust and scalable data platform capable of supporting the largest BI deployments. “Kilimanjaro” will include a set of new, easy-to-use analysis tools for managed self-service, project-code-named “Gemini,” that will enable information workers to slice and dice data and create their own BI applications and assets to share and collaborate on from within the familiar, everyday Microsoft Office productivity tools they already use. Customers and partners will be able to gain early access to “Kilimanjaro” within the next 12 months via a community technology preview (CTP) with full product availability slated for the first half of calendar year 2010.
