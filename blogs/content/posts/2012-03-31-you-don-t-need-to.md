Last weekend I decided to do some maintenance on one of our database to see if I can get some freespace back. I use compression for some of the older tables and also reindexed the tables with a higher fill factor. After I was done, I got over 200 GB of additional free space

Here is what the database looked like before I did the maintenance

<pre>FILEID	FILE_SIZE_MB	SPACE_USED_MB	FREE_SPACE_MB
1	179353.81	162922.13	16431.69
2	    64.01	    14.33	   49.68
3	297089.13	265538.44	31550.69
4	344555.69	298126.69	46429.00
5	165258.50	123946.63	41311.88</pre>

Here is what the database looked like after I did the maintenance

<pre>FILEID	FILE_SIZE_MB	SPACE_USED_MB	FREE_SPACE_MB
1	179353.81	110124.50	 69229.31
2	  2085.63	   994.09	  1091.54
3	297089.13	259595.44	 37493.69
4	344555.69	169405.19	175150.50
5	186822.69	123962.00	 62860.69</pre>

As you can see I did nicely here, free space for fileid 4 went from 46 GB to 175 GB, for fileid 1 it went from 16 GB to 69 GB

Of course I had to brag about this and then it happened&#8230;.the sentence you never want to hear&#8230;&#8230;.how come you didn&#8217;t shrink the database, the backups will still be as big&#8230;you are wasting space&#8230;.if only I could send Paul Randal or Ted Krueger to this person&#8230;&#8230;.

So let&#8217;s debunk that myth shall we?

First create these 3 database, they will be 3 MB, 3 GB and 9 GB in size

<pre>CREATE DATABASE [TestSmall]
 ON  PRIMARY 
( NAME = N'TestSmall', FILENAME = N'C:SQLFilesTestSmall.mdf' , SIZE = 3072KB , FILEGROWTH = 1024KB )
 LOG ON 
( NAME = N'TestSmall_log', FILENAME = N'C:SQLFilesTestSmall_log.ldf' , SIZE = 1024KB , FILEGROWTH = 10%)
GO



CREATE DATABASE [TestLarge]
 ON  PRIMARY 
( NAME = N'TestSmall', FILENAME = N'C:SQLFilesTestLarge.mdf' , SIZE = 3072MB , FILEGROWTH = 1024KB )
 LOG ON 
( NAME = N'TestSmall_log', FILENAME = N'C:SQLFilesTestLarge_log.ldf' , SIZE = 1024KB , FILEGROWTH = 10%)
GO



CREATE DATABASE [TestLarger]
 ON  PRIMARY 
( NAME = N'TestSmall', FILENAME = N'C:SQLFilesTestLarger.mdf' , SIZE = 9072MB , FILEGROWTH = 1024KB )
 LOG ON 
( NAME = N'TestSmall_log', FILENAME = N'C:SQLFilesTestLarger_log.ldf' , SIZE = 1024KB , FILEGROWTH = 10%)
GO</pre>

Here is what it looks like in file explorer

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/sqlfilesorig.PNG?mtime=1333217594"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/sqlfilesorig.PNG?mtime=1333217594" width="364" height="262" /></a>
</div>

Or if you want to do this from T-SQL

exec sp_helpdb 

<pre>name		db_size	    owner		dbid	created	
----------      --------    ---------------     ----    -----------
master		4.75 MB	    sa			1	Apr  8 2003	
TestLarge    3073.00 MB	    Denis-PCDenis	9	Mar 31 2012	
TestSmall	4.00 MB	    Denis-PCDenis	8	Mar 31 2012	
TestLarger   9073.00 MB	    Denis-PCDenis	10	Mar 31 2012</pre>

You can see that the files are indeed in the GB and in the MB range

Now back the database up, these are plain vanilla backups, no compression is applied

<pre>BACKUP DATABASE [TestLarge] TO  DISK = N'D:SQLBackupsTestLarge.BAK' 
WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT,  NAME = N'TestLarge-Full Database Backup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 10
GO

BACKUP DATABASE [TestLarger] TO  DISK = N'D:SQLBackupsTestLarger.BAK' 
WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT,  NAME = N'TestLarger-Full Database Backup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 10
GO

BACKUP DATABASE [TestSmall] TO  DISK = N'D:SQLBackupsTestSmall.BAK' 
WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT,  NAME = N'TestLarge-Full Database Backup', SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 10
GO</pre>

Navigate to the folder and what do you see?

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/sqlfiles.PNG?mtime=1333217577"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DataMgmt/Denis/sqlfiles.PNG?mtime=1333217577" width="449" height="204" /></a>
</div>

That&#8217;s right there is only MBs difference between the 3MB database and the 3 GB database. I checked my production server and the backup took 30 minutes less to complete compared to the backups that ran before I freed up space

I won&#8217;t go into details here why shrinking the database is bad but I can guarantee you that it is no coincidence that shrink could mean _making the database smaller_ and _psychiatrist_ ðŸ™‚
