After upgrading my SQL Toolbelt installation recently, I came across a new entry in the SQL Prompt menu that is integrated into SQL Server Management Studio. So I have decided to put out a quick post on one of the features which I find is handy.

With the new SQL Toolbelt, I&#8217;ve also installed the Redgate integration which integrates all the tools for you into Management Studio. On my way to make some changes to my configuration for SQL Prompt, I noticed the Experimental Features&#8230; portion which altered my curiosity setting to a full 100%.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/Menu.jpg?mtime=1329394384"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/Menu.jpg?mtime=1329394384" width="282" height="472" /></a>
</div>

This results into the following screen with all its interesting beta programs,features,etc.

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/redgate_labs.jpg?mtime=1329394405"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/redgate_labs.jpg?mtime=1329394405" width="762" height="633" /></a>
</div>

After reading through the descriptions, SQL Tab Magic caught my attention the most as I regularly have multiple query tabs open within SSMS. After downloading and installing it, you will see the following toolbar set appear:

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/toolbar.jpg?mtime=1329394414"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/toolbar.jpg?mtime=1329394414" width="281" height="26" /></a>
</div>

This will show you(after the installation) all the closed or open query tabs with a portion of the query. For example:

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/OpenTabs.jpg?mtime=1329394394"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/users/sqlarcher/Redgate_SQLTabMagic/OpenTabs.jpg?mtime=1329394394" width="773" height="361" /></a>
</div>

You can also through the toolbar, set it to look for new tabs and configure it to open any tabs on start up that you had open in a previous session.

There are a few other labs as well which you can find at [RedGate Labs][1] all though they don&#8217;t feature SQL Tab Magic there.
