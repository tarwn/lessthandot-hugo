  You may or may not have noticed it after installing SQL Server 2012: the designer interface in Visual Studio 2010/2012 has had a make-over. Nothing too drastic, but at least the undo button works. However, sometimes when you drag or move tasks/components on the canvas, they start to shake. A lot. And very annoyingly as well. (Quite impossible to take a screenshot of that, so sorry). This behaviour emerged after applying CU6. There are Connect items logged about this issue:
</p>

  * [When dragging SSIS objects on canvas the objects shake/jiggle/jitter][1]
  * [SSIS 2012 Control Flow moving objects is unusable][2]

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Luckily Microsoft patched this bug in CU7. You can download the hotfix <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2883424/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0">here</a>. If your environment is up-to-date with the latest patches, most likely you won&#8217;t experience this bug.

  I patched the Visual Studio 2010 environment at the client and the issue went away. But at home I use Visual Studio 2012 and the issue was still there, even after applying the fix. Fortunately, Twitter was there with the answer:

    <a href="https://twitter.com/Ko_Ver">@Ko_Ver</a> Ok, because the CU that fixes that only updates the DLL&#8217;s for VS2010, you need to manually overwrite the assemblies in VS2012 folder

If you go back to the [first Connect item][1], these steps are described in the work arounds and they work like a charm.

The issue has also been [reported for SSIS 2014][3], and while the item has been closed as fixed, there&#8217;s no explanation on how it is fixed. Maybe in an upcoming CU for SQL Server 2014? It&#8217;s possible the same work around works for SSIS 2014, but I haven&#8217;t tried it (I don&#8217;t have the bug in Visual Studio 2013) so if you do try it, it&#8217;s at your own risk.
