For those who haven't noticed already:

SQL Server 2016 CTP2 (or Preview as some call it) has just been released!
  
This means it is play time! ðŸ™‚

You can either download a copy if you're old school like me, or you can spin up a VM in Azure like all the cool kids.

[SQL Server 2016 first public preview now available!][1]

Some of my favorite features (although some are not yet in the preview):

  * SSIS incremental deployment model (aka deploy only 1 package to the SSIS catalog). Although I understand the reason of the SSIS team to first allow only deployments of full projects, there are a lot of customers that want this functionality.
  * Power Query in all the things! (more specifically: in SSIS and SSRS)
  * R integration in SSRS (this should allow you to do amazing things with SSRS)
  * SSRS revamp (still have to see it though, but I'm already excited!)
  * [Temporal tablesÂ ][2]
  * [Live query plans][3] (seems pretty awesome)
  * DAX enhancements (many 2 many, median, percentiles, and so on)

Here's a good overview of what you can expect in SQL Server 2016:

[BI on your terms with SQL Server 2016][4]

Be careful, if you install Polybase, you apparently need the Oracle JRE. Boooo.

Anyway, a lot of goodness and I am very excited about this release.
