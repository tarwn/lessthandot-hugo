Today at PASS the SQL Server team has publicly announced the first Community Technology Preview of the next version of SQL Server code named Denali. You can download it here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=6a04f16f-f6be-4f92-9c92-f7e5677d91f9

I have been playing around with Denali for a couple of weeks now and created a couple of posts. Below is a list of the posts, click on each link to get some more information about Denali

[First look at SQL Server Management Studio Denali][1]

[Screenshots of the new look and feel of BIDS in Denali][2]

[Find what is deprecated in SQL Server Denali by using sys.dm\_os\_performance_counters][3]

[Playing around with sys.dm\_exec\_describe\_first\_result\_set and sys.dm\_exec\_describe\_first\_result\_set\_for\_object][4]

[A first look at sequences in SQL Server Denali][5]

[Donâ€™t install Denali BIDS side by side with a 2008 instance][6]

<The new Dynamic Management Views in SQL Server Denali>

[Debugging In SQL Server Denali][7]

[Using OFFSET N ROWS FETCH NEXT N ROWS ONLY In SQL Server Denali for easy paging][8]

These posts were all written without documentation available, it was mostly guess work but since documentation will be available with the public release of the CTP I will go into more detail the next couple of weeks
