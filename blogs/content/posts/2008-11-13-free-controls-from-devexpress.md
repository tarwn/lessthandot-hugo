[DevExpress][1] have released a collection of free ASP.NET controls that you can use &#8220;without royalties or distribution costs&#8221;. The applications you create with these controls can be distributed royalty free and all the controls are are fully supported by both Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008.

Some of the ones I think stand out as potentially being very useful are the:

TextEdit
  
ProgressBarControl
  
XtraTabControl
  
SplitterControl
  
ASPxCloudControl

For a full list, visit http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Free/WebRegistration60. You&#8217;ll need to register so they can send you your account details and instructions on how to download and use the controls.

I&#8217;ll be trying a few of these out over the next couple of weeks, so let us know if you&#8217;ve tried them and what your thoughts are on them.
