Back in January, Lara Rubbelke ([Blog][1] | [Twitter][2]) and I released V2 of the [Separation of Duties Framework][3] for SQL Server. If you haven't checked it out yet I suggest you do. It's a framework that helps you design a more restrictive and granular environment for administration within SQL Server. Originally, Lara released the first version during the 2010 PASS Summit and was gracious enough to allow me to collaborate with her afterwards. Since the release of version 2 we have been brainstorming and coming up with enhancements that we would like to see in coming versions.

This is where you, the users and community come in, we want to hear from you. We want to hear how you use it and what you would like to see in future release. Have you used the framework and thought "Wow, this is nice, but I really wish it had X feature.". Well then, you're in luck! Now is your chance to let us know what you would like to see in future versions. Leave a comment on this blog post, drop me an email, send me a tweet. We really want to hear from you! Help us make the SQL Server Separation of Duties Framework even better by sending us your comments, thoughts, and suggestions.
