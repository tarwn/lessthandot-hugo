Just a quickie from the Silverlight front today. 

Visual States and the VSM are awesome tools to handling most of your application&#8217;s animations. One annoyance though, Visual States do not have a .Completed event!

Luckily for us, Visual States are composed of Story Boards. Story Boards DO have .Completed events ðŸ™‚

To get it to work, it&#8217;s really simple. First, create your event handling method:

<pre>Private Sub SomeStoryBoard_Completed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) 
     MessageBox.Show("StoryBoard Completed!")
End Sub</pre>

Next, in your LayoutRoot_Loaded method, add a handler:

<pre>AddHandler Me.MyVisualState.Storyboard.Completed, AddressOf SomeStoryBoard_Completed</pre>

Where &#8220;MyVisualState&#8221; is the name of the visual state you are trying to work with.

Nothing too fancy there. You just have to know that a VisualState contains a story board and that you can wire up that story board&#8217;s completed event. 

There is another way, that is even more simple, but it appears to not be working as intended. If you have any idea&#8217;s why the following doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;d love to hear about it.

Start by going into the XAML and finding the Storyboard in the Visual State you are trying to work with. Once you&#8217;ve found it, give the Storyboard a name (x:Name=&#8221;sbSearchOpen&#8221; on line 11 in the following example)

<pre>&lt;VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups&gt;
	&lt;VisualStateGroup x:Name="SearchBox"&gt;
		&lt;VisualStateGroup.Transitions&gt;
			&lt;VisualTransition GeneratedDuration="00:00:00.6000000"&gt;
				&lt;VisualTransition.GeneratedEasingFunction&gt;
					&lt;CubicEase EasingMode="EaseOut"/&gt;
				&lt;/VisualTransition.GeneratedEasingFunction&gt;
			&lt;/VisualTransition&gt;
		&lt;/VisualStateGroup.Transitions&gt;
		&lt;VisualState x:Name="SearchOpen"&gt;
			&lt;Storyboard x:Name="sbSearchOpen"&gt;
				&lt;DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames BeginTime="00:00:00" Duration="00:00:00.0010000" Storyboard.TargetName="grdSearch" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(FrameworkElement.Height)"&gt;
					&lt;EasingDoubleKeyFrame KeyTime="00:00:00" Value="85"/&gt;
				&lt;/DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames&gt;
				&lt;ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames BeginTime="00:00:00" Duration="00:00:00.0010000" Storyboard.TargetName="grdNavSearch" Storyboard.TargetProperty="(FrameworkElement.Margin)"&gt;
					&lt;DiscreteObjectKeyFrame KeyTime="00:00:00"&gt;
						&lt;DiscreteObjectKeyFrame.Value&gt;
							&lt;Thickness&gt;0,0,0,85&lt;/Thickness&gt;
						&lt;/DiscreteObjectKeyFrame.Value&gt;
					&lt;/DiscreteObjectKeyFrame&gt;
				&lt;/ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames&gt;
			&lt;/Storyboard&gt;
		&lt;/VisualState&gt;
	&lt;/VisualStateGroup&gt;
&lt;/VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups&gt;</pre>

Then we can switch to the code behind and in the object list select the sbSearchOpen story board, and in the event list select Completed. This will generate the sbSearchOpen_Completed event:

<pre>Private Sub sbSearchOpen_Completed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles sbSearchOpen.Completed
        MessageBox.Show("Search Opened!")
    End Sub</pre>

Totally an easy and intuitive way of catching the end of a story board. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t work. The IDE acts like it expects it to work, but for some reason, at run time, the sbSearchOpen_Completed method will never fire.
