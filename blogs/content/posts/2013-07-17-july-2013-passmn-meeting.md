One of the many things that I enjoy about serving as Chapter Leader of <a href="http://minnesota.sqlpass.org" target="_blank">PASSMN</a>, is the opportunity to bring in a nationally recognized speaker for one of our monthly meetings. Our meeting next week will be one of these opportunities.

PASSMN is pleased to welcome author, SQL Server MVP, and SSIS Expert Brian Knight ( <a href="https://twitter.com/brianknight" target="_blank">t</a> | <a href="http://www.bidn.com/" target="_blank">b</a> ) to speak at our July 2013 meeting. Brian is the owner and founder of <a href="http://www.pragmaticworks.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Works</a> and literally wrote the book on SSIS. We are very excited about this opportunity and are expecting an overflow crowd.

> Ninja Data Visualization Moves by Brian Knight
> 
> Abstract: PowerPivot and PowerView brings with it some amazing business intelligence and data visualization enhancements. Watch how you can improve data cleansing with Excel 2013 and some of the new features integrated into Excel and the other Office tools to visualize data better than ever before. See how the new PowerPivot and PowerView features in Excel 2013 take your data to the next level of visualization. We’ll also show how you can visualize map data with GeoFlow and tie disparate data together with Data Explorer.
