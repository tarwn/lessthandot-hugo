On Friday, I&#8217;m heading down to the Windy City for one of my favorite events &#8211; [SQL Saturday #67, Chicago Edition][2]. This event will be held Saturday, March 26, 2011. The organizers and volunteers have put together another amazing event. There will be over 300 attendees, 40 sessions, lunch from [The Meatyballs Mobile][3], and a chance to catch up with old friends and meet new ones! 

I will be presenting &#8220;Make Your Voice Heard!&#8221; at 2:30 PM. This session is going to cover the different ways you can share your SQL Server knowledge, and network &#8211; LinkedIn, Twitter, forums and blogging. I&#8217;ll give you information on how to start each, tips and tricks, and real-life success stories. There will also be construction paper and crayons! 

While eating your Meatyballs lunch, make sure to catch our Women In Technology lunch panel! I will be practicing for my role at PASS Summit 2011 (yes, you heard that right!) by moderating a discussion on &#8220;Energizing the Next Generation&#8221;. Speakers include Wendy Pastrick, Hope Foley, Kim Tesserau and Miyaka Tabe. 

Be sure to stick around afterward &#8211; there will be an after party at the Hampton Inn in Addison (just down the road, I hear). I&#8217;m also organizing a group run on Sunday morning, so if you&#8217;re interested in joining that shoot me a message. 

So, in the words of Miracle Max, &#8220;Have fun storming the castle!&#8221; It won&#8217;t take a miracle to have a great time and learn a lot at this event!
