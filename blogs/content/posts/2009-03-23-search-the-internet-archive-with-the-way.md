Surprisingly not many people know but there is an actual internet archive. Yes they have snapshots through history of the internet. Not many sites get by without having snapshots done when alterations to the sites core structure is found. If you've been in web development for awhile or did web development years back I would check it out. It's fun to remember just how bad some of the sites you built were ðŸ™‚

You'll even get a good laugh checking out sites like google when it was in beta

Hope this inspires you to create better designs than we used to.

The Internet Archive description..
   
<span class="MT_smaller"><br /> The Internet Archive is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that was founded to build an Internet library, with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers, historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format. Founded in 1996 and located in the Presidio of San Francisco, the Archive has been receiving data donations from Alexa Internet and others. In late 1999, the organization started to grow to include more well-rounded collections. Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software as well as archived web pages in our collections.</span>
