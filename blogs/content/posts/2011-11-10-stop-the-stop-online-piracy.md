Anyone from outside the US can safely ignore this post, though the details may provide a scary glimpse of what may be coming in your fair countries as well. I try not to get into politics too much, but as this bill could effect the livelihoods of several of our readers I felt this was worth discussing. I may not be following the right people on twitter, but I have not heard much discussion of the bill outside some of my libertarian-leaning friends. In short, a bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives that is intended

> To promote prosperity, creativity, entrepreneurship, and innovation by combating the theft of U.S. property, and for other purposes.

You can see the full text of the bill at [OpenCongress][1]. The language of the bill is very vague (the cynic in me suspects intentionally so) but seems it would grant fairly sweeping powers to the government (and to &#8216;qualifying plaintiffs') when it comes to dealing with alleged perpetrators of copyright infringement.

If you don't have time to wade through it, you might be interested in what the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][2] has to say. Or maybe [Justin Bieber's][3] take will be more to your liking. [Mike Masnick][4] has also had quite a bit to say, including an [open letter to Chris Dodd][5] that's co-signed by some prominent internet developers and venture capitalists.

That's all I really have to say. I strongly believe anyone who works in the information technology industry should read as much as they can about this bill, and form their own opinion. And if it's not a favorable opinion, you can participate in [American Censorship Day][6] on 11/16.
