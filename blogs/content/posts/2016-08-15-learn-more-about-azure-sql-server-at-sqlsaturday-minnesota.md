I'm excited to cross the Mississippi River again this autumn to present at <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/557/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQLSaturday #557 Minnesota 2016</a>.

First, I'll be giving a full-day pre-conference session, “Get Started With SQL Server in Azure”, on Friday, September 30. Tickets are only $110, include lunch, and you'll get to hear me talk about

  * What you need to know about Azure networking before creating a single database
  * The differences between the IaaS and PaaS offerings, and when to use each
  * How to create, manage, and monitor IaaS SQL Server VMs
  * How to create, manage, and monitor PaaS SQL Databases

Every attendee will get a link to my GitHub repository with scripts to accomplish many of the tasks I talk about! <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sqlsaturday557preconreg/home#CL1" target="_blank">Register today for this great class</a>!

Second, I'll be attending and presenting on Saturday, October 1. My session is “SQL Server in Azure: Essentials for the Database Administrator”. I cover what DBAs need to know about SQL Server VMs, SQL Database, networking, security, and monitoring to make Azure fit into their current environments.

But I'm giving only <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/557/Sessions/Schedule.aspx" target="_blank">1 of 48 sessions</a>! SQLSaturday has something for everyone &#8211; the DBA, the database developer, the BI practitioner. I hope to see you at SQLSaturday Minnesota!
