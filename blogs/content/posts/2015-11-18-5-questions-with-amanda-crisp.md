Up next in my 5 Questions series is an interview with a dog-rescuing, SAN-loving DBA from Minnesota &#8211; Amanda Crisp (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-crisp-b36a452" target="_blank">linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/rottengeek" target="_blank">twitter</a> | <a href="https://rottengeek.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>).

Amanda and I have gone back and forth across the border to the Madison and Minneapolis SQL Saturdays many times, and always make sure to catch up. She&#8217;s one of the sharpest DBAs I know, and, much like Meagan, another dog-lover!

### When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?

I wanted to be a cosmologist. Lots of adults thought I meant &#8220;cosmetologist&#8221; and there was a lot of confusion for a while. Then a veterinarian, an Olympic ice skater and a war correspondent.

### What&#8217;s your job title, and what do you _do_ every day/week?

I am a &#8220;Sr. SQL Server DBA.&#8221; I troubleshoot a variety of homegrown and 3rd party applications, which means analyzing SQL server errors, digging into the code, error logs, virtualization environment and actual hardware. I start each day by logging onto my V-Center, our SAN administration tool, our SQL monitoring tool, and scanning my emails for specialized errors and alerts I&#8217;ve set up. I do a lot of capacity planning.

Every day is different, and I love it.

### Let&#8217;s talk SANs. To most DBAs, they are a black box, but you&#8217;ve embraced them. What is the best way for DBAs to learn more about them?

ASK. Don&#8217;t be afraid to admit that you don&#8217;t know how it works. I&#8217;ve found most SAN admins to be very forthcoming &#8211; like a lot of technology professionals, they love talking about what they do. It is all in the approach &#8211; imagine the difference between people who ask you &#8220;why&#8221; when their agenda is really to shift blame to the DBA, and those who obviously really want to understand how it works. &#8220;How does it work?&#8221; is a much better approach than &#8220;why&#8221;. Also: don&#8217;t ask &#8220;why&#8221; in the middle of an outage. Very important. ðŸ˜‰

### You love rescuing dogs! Tell me a little bit more about some of the dogs you&#8217;ve had.

I could go on forever. I used to work mainly with Rottweilers, and had quite a few interesting fosters. I ended up keeping Belle, who had a pretty miserable existence until she came to stay &#8220;temporarily&#8221; with me. She was an amazing dog, and after all the awful things that had happened to her she wanted nothing more than to jump into a lap and cuddle.

I had an extremely LARGE fellow for a few nights. I used to have a utility room which was perfect for the first few nights a foster stayed &#8211; nothing at ground level to get into, just the washer and dryer. I walked in the next morning to find a 100 pound dog sleeping peacefully on top of the drying machine.

### If you weren&#8217;t in technology, what completely different career would you choose, regardless of schooling required or salary earned?

Bookstore clerk. I did it for 2 years, and spending every day talking about books was wonderful.
