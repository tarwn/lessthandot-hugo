  ITPROceed 2014 is now a thing of the past, but is has been an awesome &#8211; and free! &#8211; event. A very big thank you and &#8220;well done&#8221; to the organizers. It has been a great gathering of the #sqlfamily, with superb sessions about Azure, restoring databases with PowerShell, Hekaton (yes yes In-Memory OLTP), Administration Intelligence (a new buzzword for marketing?), a glimpse into the new APS (Analytics Platform System, a blend of PDW and Hadoop that will knock your socks off) and of course my own session about data visualization.

  My session went pretty well: I had time left at the end and every demo went really OK (so sacrificing a virgin to the demo gods really does help, in case you are wondering). You can find the presentation at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KoenVerbeeck/get-more-out-of-your-data-visualizations">SlideShare</a> and you can download the demo code (SSRS report project and Excel worksheet) <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ITPROceed_DataViz_Demos.rar">here</a>.

  See you at the SQLServerDays and at ITPROceed 2015!
