Tonight I had the pleasure of presenting for a new user group, [Quad Cities PASS][1]. If you&#8217;re in the Quad Cities area the second Wednesday of the month, make sure you check it out!

I was asked to present &#8220;Make Your Voice Heard&#8221;, which is one of my favorite presentations. In it, I talk about how and why to use Twitter, forums, blogging, and presenting. Each of these is more than just a social networking website, or a way to become a &#8220;celebrity&#8221;. It&#8217;s a way for you to learn more about SQL Server, share your knowledge of SQL Server, and network with like-minded people.

The slides from my talk are [here][2]. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!
