The recording of the [webinar][1] I did for the PASS BI virtual chapter is live!
  
(Quick reminder: it was the same session as on the SQLServerDays:Â <a style="color: #c04623" href="/index.php/uncategorized/speaking-at-sql-server-days-2014/">How to (not) torment your fellow SSIS developer?</a>)

I'm quite pleased with the recording, although I sound like a drunk German scientist sometimes.

The slides can be downloaded [here][2].

Let me know in the comments if you like it or not!
