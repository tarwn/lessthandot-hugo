My goal for this year is to read 50 books. At this point I have read 27 books, so I am a little ahead. I decided to tackle the Stieg Larsson trilogy as well as the Baroque Cycle trilogy.

## First quarter 2011

[<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5301/5893969692_6ddb5088e7.jpg" width="500" height="319" alt="What I read so far this year 1st quarter 2011" />][1]

1) [Snow Crash][2] by Neal Stephenson
  
Hiro Protagonist–hacker, samurai swordsman, and pizza-delivery drive is living in the Metaverse and people start frying their brains from the designer drug called Snow Crash. Interesting book, really enjoyed the 2nd half of the book, the first part was hard to get into

2) [Boneshaker][3] by Cherie Priest
  
A steampunk book, it has people turning into zombies from some gas that inventor Leviticus Blue released when drilling into the core of the earth. One scene reminded me of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, not the best book but still entertaining

3) [Who moved my cheese?][4] by Spencer Johnson
  
Horrible, horrible reviews on Amazon. Still an interesting story of how to cope with change (or maybe being agile) Probably very suited for people in IT who complain about scope creep, changing requirements and needing to keep their skill set up to date.

4) [Brave New World][5] by Aldous Huxley
  
It was interesting…I am sure it was eye opening and way ahead of its time when it was published in 1932. Some interesting things like the use of Our Ford (instead of Our Lord and of course the assembly lines that Ford first used which is I guess a metaphor for life in the World State). Soma…the good feel drug….I wonder how he came up with that one. Reminded me of 1984, the matrix and V for Vendetta.At times it was difficult to read..and I had to re-read paragraphs.

5) [The War of the World][6] by Niall Ferguson
  
This book is about the conflicts in the 20th century and maybe a reminder what could be waiting for us????

6) [The big short][7] by Michael Lewis
  
The best book I read so far this year….deals with the financial crisis of 2007/2008 but written in a very witty way…very much like Liar's Poker..his first book…highly recommended

7) [Full Dark, No Stars][8] by Stephen King
  
Probably his best book in a looooooong time, this one has 4 short stories and some of them are real creepy.

8) [Night Shift][9] by Stephen King
  
Short stories, you probably know some of them like Children of the Corn or Graveyard Shift. Some interesting stories, I liked this book, I don't really think you can go wrong with a Stephen King book.

9) [Zombie Spaceship Wasteland][10] by Patton Oswalt
  
This is a comedy book written by a comedian..nothing to do with zombies..pretty funny at times

10) [How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes][11] by Peter D. Schiff and Andrew J. Schiff
  
Interesting book, explaining why we have the crisis and why Quantitative Easing is not the solution…also everything is explained with stories on a small island..highly recommended

11) [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo][12] by Stieg Larsson
  
A female hacker and a journalist are investigating a murder from decades ago. I really really liked this book. Some trivia..Stieg Larsson died while walking up the stairs to his publisher delivering the manuscripts..he never saw the books published!!!

12) [The Coke Machine: The Dirty Truth Behind the World's Favorite Soft Drink][13] by Michael Blanding
  
History of Coca Cola, how it started, how it is very ruthless against anything that stands in its way, this of course also includes schools that want to eliminate soda from the lunchroom. Very interesting book, highly recommended.

13) [A Heartbeat Away][14] by Michael Palmer
  
Reminded me of a cross between Dan Brown and Richard Preston(The Cobra Event, The Hot Zone, The Demon in the Freezer) During the President's State of the Union address, a terrorist releases a bio-agent with potentially fatal consequences, the only man who can save the group is a scientist the President has had locked away for treason. I really enjoyed this book.

14) [Bad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks][15] by Ben Goldacre
  
This book attacks doctors motivated by money, pharmaceutical companies and poorly designed studies.

## Second quarter 2011

[<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5308/5893445475_2ebe701cc7.jpg" width="500" height="323" alt="What I read so far this year 2nd quarter 2011" />][16]

15) [Quicksilver (The Baroque Cycle No. 1)][17] by Neal Stephenson
  
Some people would like to call this math fiction instead of science fiction, this book has Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz and other famous characters. It is a long book and takes place in several cities, one of them is Amsterdam. What really bugged me is that Stephenson mentions the IJsselmeer, well until 1932 this was still de Zuiderzee, so there is no way this existed in the 16 century.
  
Besides the factual inconsistencies I liked the book and the characters it has, for some reason it reminded me a little of Anna Karenina.

16) [Professional SQL Server 2008 Internals and Troubleshooting][18] by Christian Bolton, Justin Langford, Brent Ozar, James Rowland-Jones, Jonathan Kehayias, Cindy Gross and Steven Wort
  
A must read if you need to troubleshoot any performance problem with SQL Server, can't recommend it enough.

17) [The Selfish Gene][19] by Richard Dawkins
  
A gene's eye view of evolution, really interesting book, highly recommended.

18) [Life][20] by Keith Richards
  
Although Keith Richards has some tendencies of megalomania, I liked this book. Nothing earth shattering that we did not know already but still intersting to hear it from the person himself.

19) [The End of Wall Street][21] by Roger Lowenstein
  
A behind the scenes analysis of th crash of 2008 and what caused it. Hopefully we will learn from this. This was a good book and I really liked it.

20) [Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science][22] by Lawrence M. Krauss
  
I reviewed this here: [Book review: Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science][23]

21) [Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100][24] by Michio Kaku
  
I reviewed this here: [Review: Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100 by Michio Kaku][25]

22) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JHY9NE/ref=as\_li\_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=sql08-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B004JHY9NE">Securing SQL Server: Protecting Your Database from Attackers</a> by Denny Cherry
  
I reviewed this here: [Book Review: Securing SQL Server By Denny Cherry][26]

23) [The Girl Who Played with Fire][27] by Stieg Larsson
  
The second book in this trilogy, you will learn why Lisbeth was locked up and who her father is

24) [The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest][28] by Stieg Larsson
  
The final book in this trilogy. This trilogy is awesome, it is too bad Stieg Larsson passed away, I would have loved to read more about Lisbeth Salander, Blomkvist and the rest of the characters

25) [Bossypants][29] by Tina Fey
  
A fun book from a funny woman

26) [The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy][30] by Mark Logue
  
I didn't see the movie, so nothing was spoiled for me. A good book detailing how King George VI overcam his speech problem and what actually caused these problems.

27) [The Alchemist][31] by Paulo Coelho
  
A shepherd is looking for a treasure, he travels a lot to find the treasure not where he expected it. This is a pretty short book and will remind you of a fairy tale in a way. I liked this book even if the characters lack dept and the book is very simple.
