Waiting for your company to provide training courses or advancement opportunities? It might be a long wait. Unfortunately many companies overlook professional development or consistently sacrifice it when the first round of annual budget cuts occur. Even when we do get training opportunities, many of us continue to select classes at random, based on what seems interesting at the moment.

We live in a field that is expanding daily, where the environment we work in is drastically different from what it was 5 years ago and from what it will be 5 years from now. Whether we plan on being in a different role or not, advancing our skills and staying in step with the market is a must.

This post covers a number of helpful links and ideas for staying up to date in our field.

## Development Plans

Creating a development plan can help provide focus and give us a measure of our progress. These articles provide additional information on creating and refining our plans:

## Tools and Processes

Once we have a plan, we need to be able to execute it. Having tools to help us execute the plan, methods of communicating the plan, and tricks for finding time can all help us be successful. 

<ul style="margin: 1em 2em;">
  <li>
    The <a href="http://personalkanban.com/personal-kanban-101/" title="More information on Personal Kanban">Personal Kanban</a> site has a lot of good information on creating a visual board and process to help manage short and long term tasks
  </li>

    Jes Borland (<a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/" title="Jes Borland's blog">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/grrl_geek" title="Jes Borland on Twitter">twitter</a>) helps track her progress by reporting a <a href="http://jesborland.wordpress.com/2010/07/08/2010-quarter-2-goal-review/" title="2010 Quarter 2 Goal Review by Jes Borland">Quarterly Status</a> to her friends and the wider community

  </li>
</ul>

## Free and Cheap Resources

Not all development costs money. My own plan includes a certain amount of blog writing (free), reading a certain number of articles each week (free), an ongoing effort to keep up to date with webinars and webcasts (free), and attendance (and beginning to speak) at user groups and events (the free kind).

I can't afford Tech-Ed or the PASS Summit, but I can afford:

<ul style="margin: 1em 2em;">
  <li>
    Watching the <a href="http://www.msteched.com/" title="Watch recorded Tech-Ed sessions">recorded Tech-Ed sessions</a> for free at MSDN (I've had over <a href="http://delicious.com/tarwn/tech-ed" title="Eli's Tech-Ed Delicious bookmarks">11 hours</a> of free training so far)
  </li>
  <li>
    Watching the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/LearningCenter/SummitOnDemand/Summit2008.aspx" title="2008 PASS Summmit recordings">2008 PASS Summit recordings</a> for free (requires login)
  </li>
  <li>
    Catching free <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/default.aspx?culture=en-US" title="Microsoft Events Home">live and recorded webcasts</a> from Microsoft
  </li>
</ul>

Plus there are events like [SQLSaturday][1], [Code Camps][2], and user groups galore that don't cost $1000's to attend.

If you need more ideas, Ted ([blog][3] | [twitter][4]) posted an article with more SQL Resources [here][5] and I presented a list of ideas in <a href="/index.php/ITProfessionals/ITProcesses/there-is-never-time-for-part-1" title="Read Part 1 of the "There is Never Time For..." series">Part 1</a> of the “There is Never Time For…” series.
