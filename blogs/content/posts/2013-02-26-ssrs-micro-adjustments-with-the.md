Does it every bother you when you use the Arrow Keys to move an object in your SSRS report that it jumps much further over than you really wanted? Maybe you just wanted to nudge it a few pixels to the left but instead it is now over lapping the next object.

I used to think that I had to either use my mouse to move it over or start playing with the position coordinates in the properties of the object.

NOT ANYMORE!

To make micro adjustments using the Arrow Keys, simply hold down the Ctrl Key at the same time.

It may seem odd to post such a simple and short article, but this little tip saves me a fair amount of time and swearing at my computer. I hope it does the same for you as well!
