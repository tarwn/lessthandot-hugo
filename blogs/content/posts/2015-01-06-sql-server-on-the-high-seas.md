It's a new year, you (hopefully) have a new training budget and vacation time, and I hope you'll consider <a href="http://sqlcruise.com/hub-2015/" target="_blank">SQL Cruise Caribbean 2015</a>. It departs Miami, FL on Saturday, February 7, 2015; stops in Saint Maarten, US Virgin Islands, and Bahamas; and returns to Miami on Saturday, February 14, 2015. In between, there are hours of in-depth SQL Server training!

### 5 Reasons to Board Norwegian Getaway for SQL Cruise

**Have you checked the weather report lately?** It's 9°F/-12°C currently, where I am. I, for one, am looking forward to escaping to the Caribbean.

**Small group training.** You'll be learning in a room with less than 30 people. This means eye contact with the instructors, whom you'll know by name by the first day. When you raise your hand to ask a question, it will be answered. And your fellow cruisers are also industry veterans with years of experience to draw from.

**From fantastic instructors.** Learn about execution plans from Grant Fritchey ([blog][1] | [Twitter][2]), who literally <a href="https://www.simple-talk.com/books/sql-books/sql-server-execution-plans,-second-edition,-by-grant-fritchey/" target="_blank">wrote the book about them</a>; learn how to be the best DBA from Kevin Kline ([blog][3] | [Twitter][4]), a long-time data professional with loads of great career advice; and learn about virtualized SQL Servers from David Klee ([blog][5] | [Twitter][6]), who is both a Microsoft SQL Server MVP and a VMware vExpert.

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  Shameless plug: I'm one of the instructors, too, and I'm stoked. "Automating: The Effective DBA" is a session on tools you can use to automate your job – freeing up time for new projects, upgrades, and maybe even catching up on all those SQL Server blogs! I will talk about one of my favorite tools, SQL Server Agent, along with overviews of tools like SSIS and PowerShell.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  "Restore Methods for Database Recovery" is one of my favorite topics. Restoring databases can be straightforward, or you can employ special features and commands to do things like restore to a specific point in time, or bring part of the database online at a time. I love talking about how to keep your data safe and highly available, so I'm really excited for this session.
</p>

**Office Hours.** Imagine if you could take one of your favorite instructors, sit her  down, and have a beverage with her while picking her brain about topics from what it's like to be a DBA at a Fortune 500 company to the latest features in SQL Server 2014, career planning, the consulting life, work-life balance, and more. That's Office Hours. These are some of the best hours on the cruise.

**Friendships.** Your fellow cruisers will be lifelong contacts for you. You will help each other solve problems and find jobs. And maybe go on the next SQL Cruise together.

**Bonus:** rock climbing wall!

### Ready to pack your bags?

Go to <http://sqlcruise.com/registerme/> to get started. At only $1,395 for the training, plus the cost of the cruise (lodging, food, and beverages are all included), this is a bargain for a week of SQL Server training!

Are you already busy that week, or looking to travel further? Consider SQL Cruise Mediterranean in June 2015!
