It's the end of the third quarter. What a fun year! Right now, I'm practically falling out of my chair with excitement. Next Friday, I leave for a nine-day trip that includes [SQL Saturday #92][1] in Portland, OR; the [Portland Half Marathon][2]; and [PASS Summit][3] in Seattle, WA. Who needs sleep? 

So, three-quarters of the way through the year, how am I doing on my [2011 goals][4]? 

**Blogging** 

Thumbs up. Way up. I had 9 blogs this quarter, including three of my favorite of all time. I talked about [user groups][5], [PowerShell punctuation][6], and [making SSMS awesome][7]. And I'm back in the writing groove. I have one new series started already, and two more ideas.

**Presenting** 

3 user groups? Check.
  
3 SQL Saturdays? As of next Saturday, check.
  
1 other event? Check, a couple times over. 

I could present every day. I am already working on where I will try to present next year. 

**Attend PASS Summit** 

12 days and counting. I'm so excited, I can't focus. I'll be in a first timers group, I'm participating in the Quiz Bowl at the welcome reception, I'm presenting Reporting Services 201 on Wednesday, and I'm moderating the WIT lunch on Thursday.

**Support Cool Community Projects** 

I'm almost ready to let the cat out of the bag about my latest project. Almost. Stay tuned for details. 

Note to self: get better at saying "no". That's hard for me. 

**Help Others** 

I hope I am doing this, every single day.

**Help Myself** 

I learn more every week than I ever imagined I would, and it's wonderful. I'm still figuring out XEvents and XQuery. I still need to reschedule that certification exam. It seems less important now than it did at the beginning of the year. 

**Running** 

I am very close to my goal of 500 miles for the year. I'm running in my second half marathon next weekend. I would give this goal a thumbs up as well!

**Three More Months!** 

What do October, November and December hold for me? Lots! PASS Summit, that thing I desperately want to blog about, and hopefully a lot of writing. This has been an amazing year.
