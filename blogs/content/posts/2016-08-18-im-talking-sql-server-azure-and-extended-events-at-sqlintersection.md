I’ll be in Las Vegas October 24-28, 2016 for [SQLintersection][1], part of the [DEVintersection][2] conference series! Why attend DEVintersection? It “brings your favorite Microsoft leaders, engineers and industry experts together to educate, network, and share their expertise with you. Just this year, ASP.NET Core, SQL Server 2016, Visual Studio 2015, Windows 10 and SharePoint 2016 launched. The new release of Windows Server is on the horizon and open source is becoming the norm. The cloud is real and so is cloud scaling. Are you ready?”

What’s that about SQL Server and Azure? I’m talking about both of them a lot that week! On Monday, October 24, I’m leading a full-day workshop, Get Started With SQL Server In Azure. This is seven hours of discussion about Azure fundamentals, the difference between IaaS (VMs) and PaaS (SQL Database). I talk about when to use each, along with how to create, maintain, and monitor them. If your organization wants to start putting data in Azure (or has already started), you don’t want to miss this!

But that’s not it! I have three other sessions throughout the week.

  * SQL Server in Azure: Essentials for the Database Administrator – In this 75-minute session, I distill the most important information any DBA needs to know about SQL Server VMs and SQL Database. You’re going to learn how to choose the right service, how to perform your essential admin tasks, how to monitor them, and more!
  * SQL Server in Azure: Essentials for the Database Developer – This 60-minute session covers what you need to know about writing and tuning T-SQL for SQL Server VMs and SQL Database. There are differences in syntax and tools; join me to learn more!
  * Everyday Extended Events – First, go to Erin Stellato’s session, Kicking and Screaming: Replacing Profiler with Extended Events. She covers all the basics – what XE is, how to create sessions, and how to view the data. Then, stick around for my session, where I show you the sessions used most frequently. Tasks like capturing query performance, gathering deadlock information, and integrating XE and SQL Server Agent will be covered.

There are dozens of other SQL Server workshops and sessions, not to mention the Azure, Visual Studio, and SharePoint sessions running concurrently. On Thursday evening, you won’t want to miss SQL after Dark, hosted by Paul Randal & Kimberly Tripp! Check out [the full SQLintersection schedule here][3]! Hurry and [register today][4]! Prices increase on September 13, and again on September 28, so don’t delay!
