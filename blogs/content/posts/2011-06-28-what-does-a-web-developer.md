What is a web developer? Recently I was involved in a discussion about the skills a web developer is expected to have and how interesting it has been to watch common bad practices (like table layout and SQL injection) continue to spread. So in the nature of Denis's [What does a SQL Server developer need to know?][1] post, I present the web developer breakdown.

## What Level Am I?

Rather than try and attach years of experience to this scale, I'm going to present a list of major areas and skills, questions, or topics in each area. I've tried to capture whether I feel a skill is required to be an Intermediate or Advanced web developer. 

I put this list together based on my own experience, 20-30 web developer interview lists, and some feedback from others.

Beginner: Knows some of the items on the list
  
Intermediate: Knows most intermediate items and some advanced
  
Advanced: Knows almost everything on the list

## What's Missing

There are several things that were intentionally left out of this list. Some were hard to quantity in a general manner, others I was unsure how relevant they were. And I'm sure people will be kind enough to add additional oversights and revisions below.

Missing Categories:

  * Level of knowledge with server-side languages
  * Project management skills
  * Documentation and Modeling skills
  * Design and Graphics skills
  * Application Lifecycle Management – Source Control, Deployment, etc

Extra items that didn't make it in:

  * Can implement RSS and ATOM feeds
  * Can implement a web farm
  * Implemented single-signon (openID, SAML, etc)
  * Knows how to implement XML data islands (still relevant?)
  * Knows how to create DTDs and/or XSDs
  * Can write regular expressions without a reference
  * Knows relevant tools for Yahoo (SiteExplorer), Google, Bing for managing site information
  * Schema.org – it belongs in the Meta category but I didn't know what level of skill, knowledge, or adoption I should include considering it's newness and several other factors

There is also the fact that we often get caught up maintaining or even adding on to a site that violates many of the skills and standards you see in this list. This doesn't prevent us from writing good, clean, semantic sites the rest of the time and being forced to write poor code does not make on inherently less skilled.

## A Brief Digression, or Why an App Dev is Not a Web Dev

At one point web development was seen as less exciting and far less complex than application development. It is still seen as extremely similar to application development, so much so that it is quite normal to hire a good or great application developer and expect them to be a good or great web developer. 

Unfortunately it doesn't quite work that way, as web development has grown extremely complex since the first dynamic sites started showing up in the late 90's. Doubly unfortunately, web development is based on a stateless model instead of the stateful one most application developers are used to, uses a fluid layout instead of the grid layout, and sneaks a lot of extra communications and caching into the mix. This is a series of paradigm shifts not unlike the one between procedural, object oriented, and functional programming.
