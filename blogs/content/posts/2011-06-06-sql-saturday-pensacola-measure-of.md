<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">One of the highlights of my year so far was being accepted to speak for the </span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">SQL Saturday in Pensacola #77</span>][1]<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This particular SQL Saturday took my attention because of the feedback I had heard from the previous events held in Pensacola.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Along with the great feedback and turnout that this SQL Saturday draws, there are many of my friends in the community that are in the area as well as traveling to the state of Florida to also organize, volunteer and present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Karla Landrum (</span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;">Blog</span>][2] <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">| </span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;">Twitter</span>][3]<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">), Rodney Landrum (</span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">TSEQUEL</span>][4]<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">), Aaron Nelson (</span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;">Blog</span>][5] <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">| </span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;">Twitter</span>][6]<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">) and his daughter Dorothy and others I know personally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The added bonus to the area was the opportunity to meet people like Audrey Hammonds (<a href="http://www.datachix.com">Blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Datachix2">Twitter</a>) (awesome tattoo!), Eric Wisdahl (</span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;">Blog</span>][7] <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">| </span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Twitter</span>][8]<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">) (gave me great suggestions on my demos and great conversations), Tim Radney (</span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;">Blog</span>][9] <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">| </span>[<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Twitter</span>][10]<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">) (The look on his wife's face when she saw the tattoo), Steve Jones (<a href="http://voiceofthedba.com">Blog </a>| <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/way0utwest">Twitter</a>) and so many other great presences in the community.</span></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">
  <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Beyond the fact that I gained a great deal of personal enjoyment out of this event;, it was organized and managed as well as a SQL Saturday could be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Karla is well known for the time and energy that she puts into events and the community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This one had no limits to that show of energy and the results were nothing short of a very successful SQL Saturday.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">
  <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Presenting for a SQL Saturday is a process for any presenter, new or experienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The distance brings in cost and time away from families.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Loving the feel of a good flow chart, we can review that as...</span></span>

    <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The money is the hardship for most presenters, organizers and volunteers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Although, this is a small price to pay when even one individual that attended your session comes to you after your session and express great enthusiasm about the knowledge and ideas you passed onto them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This was and is the hopes of my DBA Multiplier session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This event I had several come to me after the session and they seemed very excited about how many options had become available to them given the knowledge and concepts I passed onto them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This is what I hope to accomplish from presenting, blogging and even helping in the forums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>One person that will be more successful because of my help is why the long hours, cost and time from home seems worth it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>No matter if that is a user group with 6 people in attendance or a PASS session with 200.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>All it takes is one person to gain a little more to make their own career and jobs easier and more skilled. </span></span>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I hope to make Pensacola an annual event that I can travel to from here out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And as long as they will have me, I'll be there.</span></span>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">
    <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Thanks again to all that attended my session and the great feedback I had from everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To Karla, Rodney and the rest of the volunteers and presenters; you absolutely surpassed excellence on this one!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The SQL Community owes you thanks.</span></span>
