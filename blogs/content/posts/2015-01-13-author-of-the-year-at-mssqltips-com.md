I have the pleasure and privilege to announce that I was awarded with the ["Author of the Year" award][1] at the [MSSQLTips.com][2] website!
  
I am humbled by the recognition of my fellow peers in the SQL Server community and I'd like to thank all of you, the #sqlfamily, for voting.

Special shout-out to [Jeffery Yao][3], who won the Rookie award.

Let's make 2015 an even better year with more dazzling tips!
