I have the pleasure and privilege to announce that I was awarded with the [&#8220;Author of the Year&#8221; award][1] at the [MSSQLTips.com][2] website!
  
I am humbled by the recognition of my fellow peers in the SQL Server community and I&#8217;d like to thank all of you, the #sqlfamily, for voting.

Special shout-out to [Jeffery Yao][3], who won the Rookie award.

Let&#8217;s make 2015 an even better year with more dazzling tips!
