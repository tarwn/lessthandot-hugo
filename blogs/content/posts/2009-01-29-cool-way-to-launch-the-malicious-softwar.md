There is a cool way to launch the Malicious Software Removal Tool by Microsoft. I was listening to the [Security Now 180: Listener Feedback 58][1] podcast and Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson described a cool way to launch the Malicious Software Removal Tool

Here are both ways
  
1) Click on Start&#8211;>Run enter MRT and hit enter

2) Right click anywhere on the desktop, then select New&#8211;>Shortcut, type MRT into the edit field, and hit Next and then Finish. This will create a shortcut to MRT.exe, in this case the shortcut points to %windir%system32MRT.exe. Now you can just click on the shortcut to launch the Malicious Software Removal Tool

This will work on Vista and XP. Pretty cool right? I think everyone should listen to Security Now, If you are not subscribed to it then you should do it right now.

I will create a blogpost next week about all the podcast that I listen to
