I've spent 45 hours driving 2,340 miles in the last 18 months to found and grow [MADPASS][1]. This was the second SQL Server user group established in Wisconsin. As the Director of Communication, I helped recruit speakers and attendees. I encouraged veteran speakers to visit us and had several first-time speakers step in front of the group. I grew tremendously.

Through MADPASS, I met many local and regional SQL professionals. There are a few outstanding individuals I want to thank – my fellow board of directors. Tim Benninghoff, Tony Sebion, Matt Cherwin, and Steve Novoselac are all great leaders. They are passionate about the local community, and driven to improve it. We haven't agreed on everything, and I've learned because of that. I hope we will work together in the future.

Now, it's time for me to write a new chapter – one that involves less driving each month. Starting in September 2012, I will be leading [FoxPASS][2], a SQL Server user group for the Fox Valley area of Wisconsin. This area has needed a user group for a long time, and I'm happy that I am in a position to start and grow it. I'll be able to draw on my leadership experience from MADPASS, and there are a lot of speakers I will ask to come to Appleton (you know who you are!).

If you're in the Madison area, please join me at MADPASS on Wednesday, August 22, 2012 to say farewell and have a Spotted Cow with me! I will be back to visit, but I'll miss seeing everyone every month!

### FoxPASS – A Fox Valley SQL Server User Group

FoxPASS will meet the third Wednesday of every month (except November, because of Thanksgiving). Our first meeting is Wednesday, September 19, beginning at 5:30 pm. We'll have a roundtable discussion topic, dinner, and an hour presentation. Anyone interested in attending can view the schedule at [http://fox.sqlpass.org][2], and email <fox@sqlpass.org> to be added to our mailing list!
