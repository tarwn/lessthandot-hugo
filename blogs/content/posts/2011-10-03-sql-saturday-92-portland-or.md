Where can you get your next @grrl_geek sighting? Check out [SQL Saturday #92][1] in <del>sunny</del> Portland, OR on Saturday, October 8, 2011! 

![][2]

Check out [this schedule][3]! There are 40 presentations throughout the day, so you're sure to get your T-SQL, PowerShell, SSIS, Statistics or Denali fix. 

I'll be presenting a preview of my PASS Summit session "Reporting Services 201: From Basic to WOW!" I'm going to show you rarely-used report and table properties that make reports pop. I'll walk you through the basics of a matrix. I'll demo one of my favorite features, lists. I'll also show off one of SSRS 2008R2's best features, charts and visualizations. 

I'll be sitting on the Women In Technology lunch panel as well! Sopheap Suy will be guiding a discussion on how we recruit, retaain and succeed in the technology world. Men and women are encouraged to join the discussion! I'll be up at the front of the room with Kendra Little and Yanni Robel. 

Because this is occuring the weekend before PASS Summit in Seattle, there are people traveling from all over the country, and the world, for this event. Check out the [networking page][4]! I'm excited to meet Buck Woody – I hear he's the one person that drinks more coffee than I do. Who do you see on that list that you want to meet? Make a note of who it is, and when you see them, walk up and introduce yourself. (This is great practice for Summit.) It doesn't matter if they're a speaker, blogger, author, MVP, Microsoft employee, or a DBA down the street – we are all there to learn, talk SQL, and meet each other. Everyone I've ever met at a SQL Saturday was more than happy to talk and answer my questions. 

**Bonus** 

If you're still in town on Sunday, consider being part of the #sqlrun #screamteam! Several SQL People are going to be participating in the Portland Marathon, Half Marathon and 10K – me, Allen White, Erin Stellato, Yanni Robel, Rob Farley, Karen Lopez, Rob Drysdale, Brent Ozar and Doug Lane. Bring your lungs, noisemakers, cowbell and SQL spirit and cheer us on! A spectator's guide can be found [here][5].
