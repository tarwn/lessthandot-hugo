If you are installing SQL Server Denali CTP 1 on a computer which already has SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2 installed, please read: [Donâ€™t install Denali BIDS side by side with a 2008 instance][1]. For CTP 1 BIDS is still based on VS 2008 once they switch to 2010 this won't be a problem.

The first thing you will notice is that the icons are new, here is just a simple package that shows some of these icons

The toolbox will show you different icons depending on where you are in the designer. If you are in the data flow task you will see these icons, I have split int into 2 images because I couldn't fit it on my laptop screen

If you are in a control flow you will see these icons
