Twice a year, [PASS][1] puts on another great, free training event &#8211; [**24 Hours of PASS**][2]. This is 24 one-hour presentations spread across two days. Did I mention it's free? 

I remember the first 24HOP I attended two years ago. It was when they still did 24 hours straight. I got up at 5:00 AM local time to watch Gail Shaw talk about indexes. I think somewhere, I still have the photo of my, my computer, my coffee cup, and a clock showing the ridiculous hour. I was honored to present for the first time this spring. 

The fall 2011 theme is “Summit Preview”. Speakers from the upcoming [PASS Summit][3] will be giving previews of their presentations &#8211; me included! I'll be presenting [**Reporting Services 201: From Basic to WOW!**][4]. My session is scheduled for Thursday, September 8, at 15:00 GMT (that's 11:00 AM Eastern / 10:00 AM Central in the U.S.). Grab a cup of coffee and join me for a look at table and matrix tips and tricks, lists, and charts. Other sessions cover everything from SSAS to PowerShell to Baselines! 

[Register for FREE now][5]! On September 7 and 8, follow the #24HOP tag on Twitter for all the news and chat about the event!
