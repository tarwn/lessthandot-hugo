After a very successful previous year of presentations &#8211; three user groups, two SQL Saturdays, and 24 Hours of PASS &#8211; I decided to submit abstracts to speak at [PASS Summit][1] in October 2011. Summit is huge. It&#8217;s probably the biggest SQL Server conference in the world. It was hard to talk myself into hitting the submit button on the page. 

It couldn&#8217;t have been hard for only me, though. Thank you to everyone that submitted a session. Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if we could all present? And thank you to the PASS Program Committee volunteers for your hard work in selecting the sessions. 

The gamble paid off, though! On Wednesday, I was notified that **Reporting Services 201: From Basic To WOW!** was selected as a regular session! The abstract: 

> You have mastered the art of linking a dataset to a table in SQL Server Reporting Services. You have solid, reliable reports that you and others depend on. Learn how to take them from basic to &#8220;wow&#8221;, using features such as tablix, lists, images, and charts. At the end of this session, you will be familiar with:
  
> &#8211; Report properties such as headers, footers and backgrounds
  
> &#8211; Tablix properties such as ToolTip and NoRows
  
> &#8211; How to build and customize a matrix
  
> &#8211; How to effectively use lists, an often-overlooked feature
  
> &#8211; Adding charts to make reports visually appealing and easy to understand 

**Make Your Voice Heard** was also selected as an alternate, so I&#8217;ll have the crayons and construction paper in tow, just in case! 

> Do you like to talk, write, answer questions, and be helpful? The SQL community likes to talk &#8211; a lot! We tweet, we blog, we answer forum questions, and more &#8211; to help others. Add your voice! Learn about the different ways you can share your experience and knowledge. Once you start teaching others, you&#8217;ll realize how much knowledge you have. Attend this session to learn the basics of communicating on Twitter, asking and answering questions on forums, and how to set up and maintain a blog.

This is really exciting for me. And nerve-wracking. But mostly exciting. I love speaking, and I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;ve been given this opportunity. I hope some of you are able to attend PASS Summit, and hopefully come to my session.
