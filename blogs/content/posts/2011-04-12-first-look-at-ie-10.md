Here is what they say on the channel 9 site

> Just when you were expecting to hear more about IE9 on this opening day of Mix &#8217;11, and today we&#8217;ll be talking about the IE10 Platform Preview. IE10 builds on IE9 with support for even more standards like CSS3 gradients, multi-column, and grid layouts. In this video Rob Mauceri walks us through some of the new features of IE10 including an example of flowing of content in multi-column layouts.

Here is Dean Hachamovitch, corporate vice president in charge of the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft wearing a shirt with the IE 10 logo during the IE keynote ate Mix 11 today.

Developers can download the Internet Explorer 10 Platform Preview at http://www.IETestDrive.com and provide direct feedback through new code refreshes approximately every 12 weeks.

I wonder if they are going to do a more aggressive release schedule like the Chrome browser. Anything is better than the waiting period between IE6 and IE7, that was insane.
