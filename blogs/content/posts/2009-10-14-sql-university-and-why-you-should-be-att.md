Jorge Segarra ([@sqlchicken][1] on twitter) has put together something called SQL University over on his site at sqlchicken.com. SQLU as it has been tagged is and will be a compilation of classes put together by a highly respected group of DBAs around the SQL Server community focusing on the basics. When I look at the faculty names I can honestly say these people will not send you in the wrong direction. 

I can't say enough on how cool I think this is and how much it will give to the SQL Server community. Not only for DBAs starting off but added accomplishments to the people contributing to SQLU. Really, when you think about when you first got started in SQL Server these things were not all that easy to figure out. Today when I tell someone to configure mirroring from SSMS I take it for granted how long it really took for me to click through SSMS in order to find that Configure Security button. Yeah, still interesting it says that and not Configure Mirroring (even knowing I understand why but still...meaningful?). Either you had to pay for expensive classes to learn basic fundamentals or you had to really read between the lines of how to use things. If you're like me, you may have even took BOL to bed with you nightly and learned the old fashion way of reading the documentation. Well, even BOL has issues in that case. I think a lot will agree with me on that statement. So Jorge had the concept and put the work forth to start what to me, will be essential for beginners jumping into SQL Server 2008 (and 2005 in all). 

Anyone that ever asked what it means when we say SQL Server internals or run profiler on that to find your problem, or anything that had you starring at SSMS for a few minutes before running to Google should get into SQLU. So far the pace has been perfect and keeping with the readings on each publication; I'm again, nothing short of impressed with the content and contributions.

I'd like to thank Jorge for putting it together along with the contributors. All the readers of ltd.local should follow along with SQLU. Even after the basics are down in writing, I can see this turning into a great resource from basics to advanced levels of SQL Server knowledge. Even if you're a developer or in another part of IT, I think you'll benefit from everything that is taking place over there. This is content that will remain in the SQL Server community for a long time to come!

Also, follow through to the [SQL University Hoops First Practice][2] from Thomas LaRock and to the [computer labs][3] which is a great addition and gives you all the resources needed to follow along.

I recommend following Jorge on Twitter as well. Always a pleasure when I get the chance to jump into conversations with him.
