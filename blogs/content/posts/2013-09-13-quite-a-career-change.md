Long time since I posted something on this blog but I hope to pick up the pace again. Only the subjects of the post will slightly change.
  
Working for a large e-business integrator in Belgium can have some unexpected effects on your career. It all started almost a year ago with a simple sentence: &#8220;We want to extend our product portfolio with Product Information Management and we think you are the right person to help us with this.&#8221;
  
Well, I was free to decide, continue with SQL Server like the 12 years before or close my eyes and jump into the dark.
  
I gave it some thought, looked at the pros and cons and decided to go for it.

# Why?

After 12 years of explaining how you can prevent the unstoppable logfile growth, explaining the foreign key principles to senior developers, removing unused indexes&#8230; I found for myself I was still interested in SQL Server but not in the things I needed to do for the customers. So it was time for a new challenge and it was offered on a silver plate. So why not?
  
To make sure there was a way back, I booked the exams to upgrade my SQL Server certifications to MCSE data platform so in case of&#8230; I could still return to the market with a valid certificate for some years.
  
So I hope to share the journey of learning all about Product Information Management and a bit about E-commerce on this site.

See you soon
