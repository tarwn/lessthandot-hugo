SQL Server Days 2014 is over, but it has been one great event. A very big thanks to the organizers! My session went pretty well, somewhere around 60 attendees I would guess and they didn&#8217;t seem too bored. I saw some other great sessions as well, such as Buck Woody ([twitter][1]) on Big Data (and a fantastic keynote) and a demo session on Azure ML. I also attended Grants ([twitter][2] | [blog][3]) precon on execution plans and I definitely learned a lot.

It was great to meet up with the #sqlfamily and I can&#8217;t wait for next years edition.

I have uploaded my slides to [Slideshare][4], in case you&#8217;re interested.
