This is a quick script I had to write to regenerate MSmerge_Contents with GUIDs from a few articles. I was unable to find a good mass update procedure so, this is the next best thing. Although, this would not be effective on a large number of articles, if the need ever was there. The time to update RBR (row-by-agonizing-row) is not as effective as a article snapshot method. Watch your transaction log growth when performing these types of updates.

<pre>IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..##GUIDS') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
	DROP TABLE ##GUIDS
END

DECLARE @tbl NVARCHAR(128) = ''
DECLARE @loop1 INT = 1
DECLARE @loop2 INT = 1
DECLARE @cmd NVARCHAR(1500)
DECLARE @guid UNIQUEIDENTIFIER

CREATE TABLE ##guids (
	rowguid UNIQUEIDENTIFIER
	,rowid INT identity(1, 1)
	)

DECLARE @articles TABLE (
	NAME NVARCHAR(128)
	,dest_owner NVARCHAR(128)
	,rowid INT
	)

INSERT INTO @articles
SELECT NAME
	,destination_owner
	,row_number() OVER (
		ORDER BY (
				SELECT 1
				)
		) rowid
FROM sysmergearticles
WHERE NAME = 'Store'

WHILE (
		@loop1 <= (
			SELECT count(*)
			FROM @articles
			)
		)
BEGIN
	SET @tbl = (
			SELECT dest_owner + &#039;.&#039; + NAME
			FROM @articles
			WHERE rowid = @loop1
			)
	SET @cmd = &#039;insert into ##guids select rowguid from &#039; + @tbl

	EXEC (@cmd)

	WHILE (
			@loop2 <= (
				SELECT count(*)
				FROM ##guids
				)
			)
	BEGIN
		SET @guid = (
				SELECT rowguid
				FROM ##guids
				WHERE rowid = @loop2
				)
		SET @cmd = &#039;sp_mergedummyupdate @source_object=&#039;&#039;&#039; + @tbl + &#039;&#039;&#039;,@rowguid=&#039;&#039;&#039; + cast(@guid AS NVARCHAR(500)) + &#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;

		EXEC (@cmd)

		SET @loop2 += 1
	END

	SET @loop1 += 1
END

END</pre>
