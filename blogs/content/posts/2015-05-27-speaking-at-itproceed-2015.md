This year I have the opportunity again to speak at [ITPROceed][1], the biggest (Microsoft-related) conference in Belgium for the IT professional. The conference takes place the 11th of June at Utopolis Mechelen. My session is situated in the _Data Platform & Internet of Things_ track and is titled _<span style="color: #000000">Demystifying Power</span>_ <span style="color: #000000">BI. Basically it introduces the full Power BI stack and highlights what you can use for which purpose in order to get rid of some of the confusion that lives in the market place. The abstract:</span>

Is it an on-line cloud BI-platform? Or is it a collection of Excel add-ins? Is it a SharePoint feature? Or an off-line dashboard designer? It's all that and even more.
  
Power BI has many faces and this session aims to give a clear overview of what Power BI – Microsoft newest BI offering – is and what it isn't.
  
You will learn how you can use Power BI in your environment and how you can bring self-service BI to the next level.

You can check the full agenda [here][2]. There is still room available, so hurry up and register [here][3]. Oh wait, I didn't mention the best part yet: the event is totally free!

See you at ITPROceed!
