If you are just starting out in ASP.NET development, there are some very useful resources that will give you a good start.

First of all, I&#8217;d suggest going to [Microsoft&#8217;s ASP.NET website][1] and browsing through some of the sections there. You may want to:

1. Watch some of the [Getting Started Videos][2]
  
2. Follow the [Quickstart Tutorials][3]
  
3. Read the [ASP.NET Documentation][4]

You may also want to bookmark and read through some of these websites:

1. [4GuysFromRolla][5]
  
2. [ASP.NET Library][6]
  
3. [DotNetJohn][7]
  
4. [Bipin Joshi][8]

You can also subscribe to people&#8217;s ASP.NET blogs such as:

1. [Scott Guthrie&#8217;s Blog][9]
  
2. [Microsoft ASP.NET RSS Feed][10]
  
3. [Mark Smith&#8217;s Blog][11]
