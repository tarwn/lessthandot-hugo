[ITPROceed][1] has come to an end and what a great event it was. Kudos to the organizers and all the other speakers!

My session went pretty well, at least from my point of view, although I had to rush my demos a bit since there was only a 50 minute time slot. I prepared for 1 hour of course ðŸ™‚
  
I saw some pretty interesting stuff about Azure SQL DB and I really liked the session about Azure Stream Analytics. And I won a Bose headphone, so that&#8217;s nice as well ðŸ˜€

Anyway, you can find the slidedeck here on [SlideShare][2].
  
You can download them and use them for your own use, but with proper attribution.
