Welcome to Women In Technology week at [SQL University][2]! This is a great blog project put together by Jorge Segarra ([Twitter][3] | [Blog][4]), and contributed to by many SQL professionals. If you aren&#8217;t a student yet, head over to the website and get started!

This week, you get to meet a fantastic group of women, all of whom work with SQL Server and are involved in the community. These women are smart, talented, driven and amazing. We&#8217;re going to talk about how we got involved in technology, how we encourage children to think about tech as a career path, and what you can do to help! You&#8217;ll get to meet Audrey Hammonds ([Twitter][5] | [Blog][6]), Julie Smith ([Twitter][7] | [Blog][6]), Jen McCown ([Twitter][8] | [Blog][9]) and Wendy Pastrick ([Twitter][10] | [Blog][11]). And then, there&#8217;s me&#8230;.

**How this Grrl Became A Geek** 

Hi. My name is Jes. I&#8217;m five feet tall. I love coffee. My favorite band is the Dropkick Murphys. My favorite place is Yellowstone National Park. And I&#8217;m a Woman In Technology. How did I get here? 

I&#8217;m the second of five kids (three sisters, one brother). My parents weren&#8217;t scientists or engineers or teachers &#8211; my stepdad worked for Fire & Safety Equipment, and I had a stay-at-home mom. They didn&#8217;t go to college, and they didn&#8217;t push me towards academics or college. 

But when I was in middle school, I got accepted into the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP). We met once a week. We got to play on computers and solve logic problems and hold science fairs. I was in love. Our advisor was Mrs. Mattice. She was brilliant, encouraging, and never told us something was impossible. 

By high school, I was in the advanced math, science and English classes. I was on the Math Team and in Science Club. I got to take Trig and Physics with two of my best friends, Kristen and Amanda. I was pushed to my intellectual limits by Mr. Reese, my Trig and Calculus teacher; Mrs. Hudziak, my Physics teacher, who was smart, funny, and led us to solve problems, not just give us answers; and my counselor, Mrs. Dugenske, who carefully watched my progress, helped me attend workshops, and gave me extra volunteering and teaching opportunities. But, what I really wanted to **be** was a high school English teacher. 

Secret: I didn&#8217;t go to college right after high school (that&#8217;s a long story). I withdrew from technical college, I joined and got a medical discharge from the Army, I ran around in the punk scene and crashed on random couches and in friend&#8217;s basements for a while. 

One day, when I was starting to get my life together, my friend Frank told me that the ISP he worked for was hiring, and I should put in my resume because I had the right personality for it. I applied, I got the job, and my life changed. I spent two years learning networking, Unix, and how to blow the boys up in Unreal Tournament. I owe Frank, Brad, Bill and Jay a lifetime of gratitude. They always answered my questions, even the simplest ones; they never treated me differently because I was a woman; and they always encouraged me to learn new things. 

Fast-forward eight years, and after working my way through help desk jobs, programming, training and report writing, I&#8217;m now a full-time SQL Server DBA. I am a blogger, a speaker, and a woman in technology. And I love it. 

**Lesson Learned**

The path to IT isn&#8217;t a straight line for most people. You don&#8217;t have to be a script kiddie in high school and get your bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computer Science and get a job right after as a programmer to succeed. Some of my closest friends in the field were going to be musicians, never went to college, or have degrees in things like marine biology. What&#8217;s crucial is problem-solving skills, dedication, and most of all, passion. 

What sticks with me most through this: I remember all of my teacher&#8217;s and mentor&#8217;s names. They are the ones that encouraged me, prompted me, and believed in me. Support your local teachers. Help your kid&#8217;s teachers. Volunteer at a school. Kids will remember it. 

**A Question, and An Answer**

At SQL Saturday 50 East Iowa, after my WIT lunch session, a woman asked me, &#8220;If you had a daughter, would you _really_ encourage her to get into IT?&#8221; My answer, in less than a heartbeat, was, &#8220;Yes, if she loved it.&#8221; 

I don&#8217;t have kids, but I actively encourage my nephew and nieces to work on their math and science homework as much as their reading and their art. They all know that I work with computers, and that I love it. If they show an interest in it as they get older, I&#8217;ll be more than happy to mentor them and support them. 

**How can you make a difference?**

Mentor, teach and lead! 

I am an active member of the [JCI Oshkosh Jaycees][12]. One of our programs is to partner with an elementary school, providing volunteer and other support. We have a mentor program set up, where Jaycees go to the school one day a week and have lunch with their student. This has been a huge success, leading to better attendance, better grades, and happier kids. 

I&#8217;m also involved with our local [FIRST LEGO League][13] &#8211; lego robot competitions. (Lego robots are killer cool.) The kids are learning math, science, geometry, electronics, robotics and programming. They are also exposed to a broad range of adults, from engineers and architects to doctors and database administrators. This is an excellent program, and I love it. 

The simple fact is that one person can change a life. One kind word, one little bit of encouragement, one offer to help with a science fair project or math problem or robot build can make a world of difference. You can be that difference. Be that difference. 

**Homework**

I&#8217;d like you to write a blog post or leave a comment about the teacher that inspired you the most, particularly in the math, science or tech fields. Who was the difference in your life? 

Don&#8217;t forget to attend tomorrow&#8217;s class with Julie Smith!
