It's road trip time!

Next Tuesday, June 19, 2012, I'm packing up the Fit and heading west. I'll be in Edina, MN (somewhere near Minneapolis) to present for the [Minnesota SQL Server User Group][1], PASSMN! The group meets at 3601 West 76th Street, Suite 600 Edina, MN Â 55437. The meeting starts at 4:00 PM.

**The What, Why, and How of Filegroups** 

Every DBA must know how to create and maintain filegroups because they affect performance, maintenance, and security of your data. What are filegroups, and how do you use them? In this session, I'll show you how to create filegroups, create objects in them, move objects to them, perform maintenance, and walk through piecemeal restores.

Bonus: this presentation includes Lego!

I hope to see you there!

**Update**: I wasn't able to make the road trip (darn car troubles), but the user group was great and let me present remotely. **The presentation files can be downloaded<span style="color: #0000ee;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="/media/users/grrlgeek/PASSMN 20120619-1.zip">here</a>! </span></span>**
