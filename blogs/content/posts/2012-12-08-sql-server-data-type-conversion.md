Microsoft has made available two pdf files with a nice chart of all the data type conversions. It is pretty much the chart that belongs to the topic [CAST and CONVERT (Transact-SQL)][1]. Now you have a way of printing a nice looking chart so that you can always reference this. I think this is a great idea, Microsoft should make more of these.

The two files are _SQL Server Data Type Conversion Chart.pdf_ which is 1.7 MB, and _SQL Server Data Type Conversion Chart_grayscale.pdf_ which is 1.6 MB

Here is a small image of what the color one looks like
