This post is not a review, you can find detailed reviews all over the internet, this is just about the Windows 7 launch in New York City which I attended today. If you click on the pictures you can get larger sizes.

I am running Windows 7 on all my home machines since it became available from MSDN in August. I think that this is the best operating system that Microsoft created yet, you can tell that 8 million people have beta tested this puppy. When I upgraded my old [IBM T43 laptop][2] to Windows 7 I noticed immediately that it was faster than XP and also used less RAM, on my new desktop Windows 7 uses 600 MB less RAM (I have 6 Gigs) than Vista. My favorite new features in Windows 7 are Jump lists and Aero peek, I think people will really appreciate jump lists.

The launch even was held in Soho in a loft which was probably used as an art gallery at other times. It was interesting that this event was only for press, partners and invited guests&#8230;..this time there would be no..developers&#8230; developers&#8230; developers coming out of Steve Ballmer&#8217;s mouth ðŸ™‚

Remember Kylie from that [&#8216;cute&#8217; windows 7 commercial][4]? She was there, she introduced Steve Ballmer and he gave her a pink laptop&#8230;.very cute

Ballmer explained some of the things that happened during the creation of Windows 7.

After Ballmer was done with his presentation 7 cool things that Windows 7 can do was presented. The thing that impressed me the most is when they had video, tv and pictures on 8 different monitors from a single DELL XPS machine&#8230;.that was pretty cool. Netflix on a touchscreen looked pretty nice&#8230;.also shown was a kindle app for Windows 7.

After all this they opened a partition where all the partners had their hardware setup. Some of these devices you can see in the pictures below

The 3D Batman game was cool looking&#8230;initially I thought that the screen was fuzzy but then I noticed that I needed to wear the special glasses on the table; after I put the glasses on the game looked really crisp and had that 3D look and feel.

I spotted this Canon 7D with a 14mm 1.4 USM lens and played a little bit with it, interesting camera.

This Alienware laptop was pretty nice,keys lit up, quad core but nobody would give me a price for it:-(

There were 3 bars, one of them had a bunch of coffee machines and the other 2 had Champagne and Sodas

Maybe you know that twitter did a deal with Bing where Bing would get access to twitter&#8217;s firehouse so that it could do real time search, the pic below shows a real time search for Windows 7 which is refereshed every time someone tweets about Windows 7

At the end you got a bag, inside was a puzzle, a poster, a book, a t-shirt, playing cards and Windows 7 Ultimate Signature Edition

Now Microsoft has to wait and see how well Windows 7 will do, most if not all reviews have been positive so it should be a sure thing.
