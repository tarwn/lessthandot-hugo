Here we are with another fascinating episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show
  
Obviously this week is another slow week, here is what I found interesting this past week in SQL Land:

**[Using SQLIOSim to Diagnose SQL Server Reported Checksum (Error 824/823) Failures][1]**
  
Another good post by the PSS SQL Server Engineers

**[Enabling compression on a HEAP][2]**
  
Sunil Agarwal explains how to enable compression on a table that is a heap (i.e. it does not have a clustered index)

**[DML operations on a HEAP and compression][3]**
  
This is a follow-up to the previous article and describes the implications of DML operations on a heap

**[Managing TempDB in SQL Server][4]** and **[part 2 of this series][5]**
  
TempDB basics are explained, this is a must read!!

**[Indexing for Partitioned Tables][6]**
  
Michelle Ufford has a post showing if you should partition your index

**[LINQ to SQL: Does it have much of a future?][7]**
  
Greg Low has a nice article about the future of LINQ to SQL. Will LINQ to SQL die and be replaced by the Entity Framework?

**[What should I do when my Windows Admin wants to put an anti-virus on the SQL Servers?][8]**
  
Denny Cherry explains how to configure anti virus software if someone wants to put it on your precious SQL box

That is it for this week, I will tag the weekly posts with **SQL Friday** in case you want to see the whole archive in the future

\*** **If you have a SQL related question try our [Microsoft SQL Server Programming][9] forum or our [Microsoft SQL Server Admin][10] forum**<ins></ins>
