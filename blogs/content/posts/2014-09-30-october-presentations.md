This year is flying by! September has been an excellent month. My 24 Hours of PASS Summit preview session went well, speaking for user groups is always encouraging, and IT/Dev Connections was a blast! Now, on to October!

First up, I&#8217;m presenting at my user group, <a href="http://fox.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">FoxPASS</a>, in Appleton, WI on Wednesday, October 1. I&#8217;ll be delivering &#8220;Are Your Indexes Helping You or Hurting You&#8217;?&#8221; This session, which I&#8217;ll also be giving at PASS Summit in November, covers checking index basics such as whichÂ indexes support WHERE clauses, using included columns, statistics, and sargability to make sure your indexes support your workload. I hope to see you there!

I won&#8217;t be speaking at <a href="http://www.techontap.org/2014/08/30/tech-on-tap-3-1-nothing-but-net/" target="_blank">Tech on Tap v3.1</a> on Saturday, October 18, but I&#8217;ll be there! Tech on Tap is an all-day tech session &#8211; at a brew pub. We mix tech talk with beer sampling and a chat with the brewmaster. These events have been incredibly popular over the last three years! This month&#8217;s topic is Nothing but .NET. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tech-on-tap-v31-nothing-but-net-tickets-13322647397" target="_blank">Sign up today</a> if you&#8217;re in the area!

Then, on Saturday, October 25, I&#8217;ll be at <a href="https://www.sqlsaturday.com/332/eventhome.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Saturday #332</a> in Minneapolis, MN. I love the SQL Server community in this area, and they always have a great event with eager-to-learn attendees. I&#8217;ll be covering &#8220;Index Methods You&#8217;re Not Using&#8221;, talking about indexed views, filtered indexes, and index compression to improve performance. I&#8217;m in the last speaking slot of the day, but come all day for more great learning.

I hope you have a great month of learning!
