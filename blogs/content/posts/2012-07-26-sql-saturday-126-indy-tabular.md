SQL Saturday #126 is ALMOST HERE!  I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this event for a long time, and I&#8217;m excited to be selected as a presenter.

Join me this Saturday, 7/28/2012, in Indianapolis, IN for an introduction to Tabular Mode SSAS in SQL 2012.  We&#8217;ll spend lots of time talking about the Business Intelligence Semantic Model and what it means for you as a developer and for users as well.

You may have heard that building tabular models is fast?  We&#8217;ll find out just HOW fast it can be as we build a model from the ground up all while under the stopwatch.

Wondering whether your new project should be created as a tabular or multi-dimensional model?  We&#8217;ll talk about differences and limitations of both modeling paradigms, and I&#8217;ll offer up some suggestions on when to use which.

I hope you can join me at 1:00 PM at SQL Saturday #126 in Indianapolis, IN.  I look forward to seeing you there!
