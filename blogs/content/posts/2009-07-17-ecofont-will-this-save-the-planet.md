I saw this in National Geographic magazine 2 days ago and found it a bit interesting.
  
Take a look at this font below

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/ecofont1.jpg?mtime=1357605896"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/ecofont1.jpg?mtime=1357605896" width="266" height="60" /></a>
</div>

You probably noticed the holes in the letters, if you print this out you will save ink. According to the Ecofont website [you can save up to 20% of ink][1]

> After extensive testing with all kinds of shapes, the best results were achieved using small circles. After lots of late hours (and coffee) this resulted in a font that uses up to 20% less ink.

Of course you can save more by not printing at all. ðŸ™‚

So I decided to play around with this, I downloaded the font (you can download the font from the download link on this page: http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont_en.html) and typed up a page in Word 2007. Below is the result:

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/ecofont2.png?mtime=1357605910"><img alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/blogs/ITProfessionals/Denis/ecofont2.png?mtime=1357605910" width="563" height="705" /></a>
</div>

I increased the font size for every and also compared bold to regular. The last 2 lines have a size of 72.

So what do you think? Does this make sense? Also how much do you print on average? I really don't print that much at all, at home I don't even have a printer. As a matter of fact I haven't used a printer at home for at least 6 years or so

Will you use this font?
