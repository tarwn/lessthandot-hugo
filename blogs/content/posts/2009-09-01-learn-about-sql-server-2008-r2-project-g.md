"Madison" is a highly scalable data warehouse appliance that delivers performance at low cost through massively parallel processing (MPP). How does it work? What's the story? Well, "Madison" Product Unit Manager Christian Kleinerman sure knows the answers and he provides an introduction to this new SQL data warehousing technology

Project Gemini is an Excel 2010 add-in that allows you to create powerful analyses by quickly manipulating millions of rows of data into a single Excel workbook and utilize Microsoft Office 2010 to share and collaborate on your insights with your team."
