Microsoft has also released a press release that highlights some of the new features. Here are some of them

> Fast launching of apps from a tile-based Start screen, which replaces the Windows Start menu with a customizable, scalable full-screen view of apps.
> 
> Live tiles with notifications, showing always up-to-date information from your apps.
> 
> Fluid, natural switching between running apps.
> 
> Convenient ability to snap and resize an app to the side of the screen, so you can really multitask using the capabilities of Windows.
> 
> Web-connected and Web-powered apps built using HTML5 and JavaScript that have access to the full power of the PC.
> 
> Fully touch-optimized browsing, with all the power of hardware-accelerated Internet Explorer 10.

You can find the press release here http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx

It is interesting that you will use HTML5 and JavaScript to build apps. Steven Sinofsky also mentioned that SilverLight will run in the browsr, he did not mention anything about out of browser apps with SilverLight.
