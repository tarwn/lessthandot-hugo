July 1, 2011. Dang. It&#8217;s a gorgeous summer morning here in Wisconsin. With the amazing first half of the year I&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;m looking forward to the second half even more. 

Normally, this time of the year I&#8217;d say something like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe how fast this year is flying by!&#8221; But this year, things are different. I&#8217;ve been busy, but I&#8217;ve taken breaks too. I&#8217;ve been able to enjoy my successes, and learn from the failures. 

How awesome has 2011 been so far? 

**Blogging:**

I have written a couple very solid, in-depth technical blogs. I&#8217;m proud of them. But I&#8217;m not blogging a lot. This week, I realized why: I&#8217;ve been trying to blog about _things I have no interest in_. That was dumb. I love SSRS, and T-SQL, and solving problems. I was trying to write blogs about BULK INSERT and FILESTREAM. Why? 

My focus for the next quarter is shifting. I want one blog a week. I&#8217;m going to shoot for one high-quality, in-depth technical blog a month. I also want one &#8220;I learned this and its awesome!&#8221; post. I want to keep writing about community projects I&#8217;m working on, presentations I&#8217;ve given, etc. 

**Presenting:** 

I am in love. I would stand up in front of a room of people and teach every day if I could. In April, I presented for MADPASS, and in June I gave a presentation at SQL Saturday 75. 

Goal count: 2 of 3 user groups, 2 of 3 SQL Saturdays, and 1 other event (24 HOP). I&#8217;ve even surpassed my own expectations for the year. Read on for more&#8230;

**Attend PASS Summit:** 

Not only am I attending PASS Summit, I&#8217;M SPEAKING. Me! Jes! 

Seattle: you&#8217;ve been warned! 

**Cool community projects:**

For the first time, I volunteered for the [PASS Program Committee][1]. I was on the speaker review team for PASS Summit. That was a very interesting, enlightening and fulfulling task. I highly recommend volunteering with PASS in some capacity. They have a role to fit almost any interest. You&#8217;ll meet and get to work with some great people, too. 

I&#8217;m very involved with [MADPASS][2]. We&#8217;re holding our first official elections in August, and I&#8217;m running for the Director of Communications post. I have great ideas to grow the group, the speaker pool, the local talent, and the reach of our group. 

The [PASS WIT virtual chapter][3] is hard at work on planning the WIT lunch for PASS Summit. I&#8217;m excited that I will get to moderate the excellent panel. Yet another reason I&#8217;m looking forward to October! 

Have I said &#8220;no&#8221;? Yes! I have turned down a couple of opportunities that came my way because I didn&#8217;t have the time and energy. And you know what? People didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Jes, I&#8217;m never speaking to you again. You&#8217;ve disappointed me forever.&#8221; No, the world did not end. It was liberating. 

**Help Others:** 

Quoting myself from my first-quarter review: I hope I am doing this, every single day. 

**Help Myself:**

I took it upon myself to learn about filegroups, and am putting together another presentation on this. I also have been studying XEvents, and will be teaching my team at work about them, then working on a presentation. I learn so much every week. I still need to reschedule my certification exam, though. 

**Running:** 

My feet are on fire! I ran my first half marathon in April. This was one of the sweetest moments of my life. It was horrible weather, but I still completed the race and met all my goals. Since then, I&#8217;ve relaxed a little bit, running just one 5K. I&#8217;m gearing up for another 5K in a month, then Warrior Dash, then another half marathon. I love running. It is The Thing That Keeps Me Sane. 

I am at 300+ miles for the year, well on my way to reaching my goal of 500. 

I also got the opportunity to help a friend, Steve Jones, [celebrate his 1000th straight day of running][4]. That was a lot of fun. 

Coming up in July: my two year run-aversary. I hope you&#8217;ll join me for a run on Wednesday, July 13! 

**So Far&#8230;So Good** 

This year keeps getting better and better. I didn&#8217;t think anything could beat 2010, but 2011 is proving me wrong. I can&#8217;t thank my friends and family enough for supporting me while I do all this crazy stuff. I have to thank the people that are reading my blogs and attending my sessions for giving me a reason to keep going. And I definitely have to thank the SQL community for being so damn awesome.
