PASS has been holding quarterly phone calls with chapter leaders, Carmen, Karla, and Grant. I&#8217;ve been attending them to see what PASS is working on for chapters, how they can help me, and how I can help other chapters. In today&#8217;s call, I mentioned that I had created a survey using Google Forms, emailed it to my chapter members, and collected responses. This worked really well for me! <a href="http://fox.sqlpass.org" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3331 size-full" src="http://blogs.ltd.local/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/foxPASS-Logo_f-300x100.png" alt="foxPASS Logo_f 300x100" width="300" height="97" /></a>

I wanted to find out why people attended meetings, what was important at the meetings, and how I could make them better. By asking 9 questions, I learned valuable information. Most people attended because of the topic, although there&#8217;s a core group that attend every meeting they can. I didn&#8217;t have a diverse enough range of topics, though &#8211; I&#8217;ve been focusing too heavily on DBA topics and I need to remedy that. Members wanted an online attendance option for days they didn&#8217;t have enough time to drive to the meeting and back home, or when weather was bad. I&#8217;ve started setting up a Lync meeting every month due to that feedback. I also learned my members wanted some after-meeting social time, so now I announce that we&#8217;re heading to the Buffalo Wild Wings next door if anyone wants to grab a snack or a drink. Also, swag isn&#8217;t a big deal &#8211; that&#8217;s not why people attend &#8211; so I can take the pressure off myself to have a stash of that for every meeting.

Since this was so helpful for me, I&#8217;m sharing it with other chapter leaders: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17Jj8qFX-uJqUUFvmtvSd4l3pEld61OruEcVsmp0wj5Q/viewform" target="_blank">FoxPASS 2015 Survey</a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/?utm_source=product&utm_medium=forms_logo&utm_campaign=forms" target="_blank">Google Forms</a> was really easy to set up, use, and collect feedback with &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend it!
