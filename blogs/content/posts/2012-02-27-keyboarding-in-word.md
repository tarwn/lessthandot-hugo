Now that I have moved back over to the not-so-technical side, I find that I am having to relearn things that I probably knew a long time before but have forgotten. As I have pointed out to my friends before, I don't care so much about what tools I use so long as the job gets done. However, since I don't have ready access to dev tools at this job (since I'm not a developer in this role), I have to go back to more common office tools. It's not a bad thing, mind you, just something that I have to do and there are ups and downs to it.

I was recently asked to go manually update a bunch of Word documents with specific formatting. I hate to do things manually so naturally I sought out a way to make it go faster. Because of the formatting issues of the docs, a macro was not the most efficient method. However, I recalled that I could set my own keyboard shortcuts â€“ woohoo! In MS Word 2007, it's actually pretty straightforward. First, click on the Office button in the top left corner. This will provide the base-level menu list. 

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard1.JPG?mtime=1330380437"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard1.JPG?mtime=1330380437" width="429" height="477" /></a>
</div>

On this menu list, click on the "Word Options" button at the bottom right of the menu list. On the list on the left-hand side, click on "Customize". You will then see the following:

<div class="image_block">
  <a href="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard2.JPG?mtime=1330351484"><img alt="" src="https://lessthandot.z19.web.core.windows.net/wp-content/uploads/blogs/DesktopDev/WordKeyboard2.JPG?mtime=1330351484" width="840" height="685" /></a>
</div>

At the bottom, click on "Customize" next to "Keyboard shortcuts:" in order to view all of the menu items and to enable the creation/modification of keyboard shortcuts. That will bring up the option to customize any keyboard commands. Below, you can see that I've updated the Highlight to use the default setting (Alt-Ctrl-H) which I found didn't work as I wanted and the Alt-Q that I added and which is easier for me to use. The same, obviously, can be done for any changes that you may also wish to make.

</div>

It is little shortcuts like these that create efficiencies and, at the end of the day, shorten the time I need to do things manually and enable me to accomplish more. Hopefully this will point the way to doing the same for you.
