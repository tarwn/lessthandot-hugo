  At work we decided to start a book club, we pick a book, every week we decide how much we will read. After the week is over, we meet and then discuss what we read. We discuss what we liked, what we didn't like and also what we learned.

At work we decided to start a book club, we pick a book, every week we decide how much we will read. After the week is over, we meet and then discuss what we read. We discuss what we liked, what we didn't like and also what we learned.

Why should I have all the fun with this? I figured why not make it a virtual book club, we pick a SQL Server book and then we figure out how much we will read in a week, after the week is over we can discuss.

I suggest for the first book we start with **[SQL Server Execution Plans, Second Edition][2]** by Grant Fritchey. You can buy the book in print format or you can download the book from free by clicking on the title which will bring you to the redgate site

The book has 8 chapters

Chapter 1: [Execution Plan Basics][3]
  
Chapter 2: [Graphical Execution Plans for Basic Queries][4]
  
Chapter 3: [Text and XML Execution Plans for Basic Queries][5]
  
Chapter 4: [Understanding More Complex Query Plans][6]
  
Chapter 5: [Controlling Execution Plans with Hints][7]
  
Chapter 6: Cursor Operations
  
Chapter 7: Special Datatypes and Execution Plans
  
Chapter 8: Advanced Topics

One chapter a week should be doable for everyone. I will post my 'review' on Sunday and then you guys have the whole of next week to do yours in the comments.

After this book is done we can pick the next one, we can use a poll for that.

So who is in, leave a comment if you want to participate?
