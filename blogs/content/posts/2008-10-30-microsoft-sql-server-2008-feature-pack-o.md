Sync Services for ADO.NET is a part of the Microsoft Sync Framework. Sync Services for ADO.NET enables synchronization between ADO.NET enabled databases. Because Sync Services for ADO.NET is part of the Microsoft Sync Framework, any database that uses Sync Services for ADO.NET can then also exchange information with other data sources that are supported by Microsoft Sync Framework, such as web services, file systems or custom data stores

**Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Upgrade Advisor**
  
Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Upgrade Advisor analyzes instances of SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005 in preparation for upgrading to SQL Server 2008.
