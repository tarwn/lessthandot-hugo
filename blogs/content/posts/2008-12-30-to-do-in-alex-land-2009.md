Our resident master of passing these things along, [Denis][1] tagged me again so I guess that I&#8217;d better fill it out.

I don&#8217;t really do New Year&#8217;s resolutions, I figure that I&#8217;m so horribly broken that I&#8217;ll never fix myself so simply. Aside from paying off debts, losing weight, making millions, etc&#8230; here are some things I plan to do this year:

**Thesis:** After what seems like forever, I should be finishing my masters&#8217; degree this year. I wasn&#8217;t really feeling the idea of doing the capstone project (I have enough software projects I work on in my free time as it is, don&#8217;t really need another!). I also like writing (especially when its&#8217; not crammed into a 7 week course) so I decided to do the thesis. The paper&#8217;s going to be on the open source ecosystem. Primarily Java. I could tell you more, but then I&#8217;d have to kill you. Or have Chrissie do it ðŸ˜‰

**Crummy Web Page Rewrite:** I want to rewrite my [Crummy Web Page][2] this year, and also move it to a new host. Hoping to redesign using ASP.net MVC, cause it is so damn fun.

**Get More Familiar with JQuery:** Coming from a windows background web development has always been a bit frustrating for me, but JQuery makes it much less so. I&#8217;m hoping to get much better with it. Since I&#8217;m working primarily in web development now, these last two are part of an overall effort to become a better web developer.

**Silverlight & Web Services:** I&#8217;ve been playing around with Silverlight, and I&#8217;m very impressed. I was always kind of interested in Flash, but didn&#8217;t feel like buying some crappy Adobe software to learn it. Now Silverlight gives me a chance to do similar things with good ol&#8217; sea-pound. Learning Silverlight will force me to get better with webservices too.

**Kick Informix to the Curb:** I will probably lose my mind if this thing isn&#8217;t out of my life by the end of the year. Sorry Informix, I guess you were an upgrade from Access when they inexplicably chose to use you in 2001, but you just aren&#8217;t getting it done anymore, no matter how much hardware we give you. So I think we should see other people. Don&#8217;t cry baby. It&#8217;s not you, its&#8217; me. You could do so much better&#8230;

I think this&#8217;ll probably keep me busy for a while. If not I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll think of something. 

If I have to tag something, I&#8217;ve still got [Mark Smith][3] in my sights from the last time, and I think that [George][4] probably has some big plans for 2009 also.
