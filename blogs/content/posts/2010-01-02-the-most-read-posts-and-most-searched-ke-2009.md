So finally it is a new year and a new decade (this of course all depends if there is a year zero or not). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (yes the DJI is an average and not an index) closed lower than it was a decade ago, as a matter of fact it is a 1000 points lower now. Just keep in mind that the stock market still hasn&#8217;t recovered in Japan and that has been going on for 20 years now. We had 3 bubbles during the last decade..internet&#8230;.housing&#8230;oil. For the next decade gold is looking to be perhaps the first bubble to burst. 

During the last decade technology continued with its innovation, memory and hard drives increased by a 100 times. You had a 20 GB hard drive in 1999 now you have a 2 TB drive. Instead of 64 MB of ram now you have 6 GB of ram. You can read about my favorite technologies of the last decade here: [My top ten favorite technologies of this decade][1]

This is just a brief recap of what happened in 2009 on our site
