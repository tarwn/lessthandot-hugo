It is the second week of the month, which means two things: [T-SQL Tuesday][1], and the monthly [WI SQL Server User Group][2] meeting. 

I'm excited to announce that I will be presenting at the WI SSUG this month! Please join me Tuesday, February 8, 4:30 PM, at the Microsoft office in Waukesha, WI. I'll be giving a preview of my [24 Hours of PASS][3] presentation, **Reporting Services 201: The Next Level**. 

In this presentation, I'll cover how to take a basic table report and make it “WOW”, showing you features such as watermarks, tablix, lists and charts. I want you to realize the power of SSRS features that are easy, but not as well known. 

I look forward to seeing you Tuesday!
