There are a lot of RDBMS out there. It would be nice to assume that any one is perfect for or can be adapted to any situation, but that simply isn&#8217;t true. Each has its strengths and its weaknesses. 

When I am doing initial research on a database project, there are a few properties I will look into and questions I will ask to determine what is the best fit for that project. 

  * Pricing 
  * Vendor product support 
  * Size limit 
  * Number of users 
  * Security mechanisms 
  * Backups 
  * Export/import tools 
  * Business intelligence tools 
  * Front-end options 
  * Operating system 
  * Other hardware/resources required 

I&#8217;ve gathered this information for the following RDBMS: 

  * Microsoft Access 
  * Microsoft SQL Server 
  * SQL Azure 
  * MySQL 
  * PostgreSQL 

Having this information at my fingertips, able to be presented to a client or a project manager I&#8217;m working with, has been invaluable. I hope this reference can be of value to you too!
