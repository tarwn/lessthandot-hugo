Hi, wanted to share what I believe will be some very useful information for anyone doing a healthy dose of front end development and having similar requirements i.e. the ability to have some kind of form on an HTML5 page that can then send it&#8217;s content to some web page and/or server that will send off an email somewhere.

The interesting part here was that I had a very light front end single page website and I really didn&#8217;t want to break this design as it has all been coded in HTML5 with sprinklings of jquery all over the place to make it do the kind of magic Paul Daniels would be proud of (some old UK magician who seems to live forever).

<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-3378 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'>
  <dl class='gallery-item'>
    <dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>
      <a href='http://blogs.ltd.local/?attachment_id=3379'><img width="150" height="150" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Magic-hat-icon-150x150.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="magic-hat" aria-describedby="gallery-1-3379" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Magic-hat-icon-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Magic-hat-icon-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Magic-hat-icon.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>

I did a quick internet search and realised most of the solutions out there suggesting the generic mailer.php page that receives some data via page post then does some validation maybe and sends off an email which is great but I am a .NET guy and I wanted to do it another way!

After doing some research I came to the conclusion that I could create a simple Web Service that would eventually form the basis for my simple jQuery method to consume said Web Service by posting some json data to it, simple enough&#8230;so how did I achieve this? Â Pretty simple actually.

Step 1: Build a Web Service

First step is pretty easy, just fire up Visual Studio 2013 (I happen to use the awesome VS 2013 Community Edition, props to (the new) Microsoft for this):

{todo add pictures below}

  * Create a new empty solution
  * Add a new Empty C# Web Project ensuring .NET 4.5 is selected (C# > Web > ASP.NET Web Application)
  * When you see the project type dialog box simply choose &#8220;Empty Web Application&#8221;
  * Right-click the empty Web Application project and select Add > New Item
  * Scroll to the bottom of the new item list and select &#8220;Web Service&#8221;
  * Give the web service a name like &#8220;MailerWS&#8221; so you get a meaningful namespace
  * Right-click the Web Service .asmx page and select &#8220;View Code&#8221; to display the C# code-behind
  * Modify the code to look like this (<a title="Thanks to Max Slaybak for the original idea" href="http://maxslabyak.com/c-sharp/using-jquery-to-send-email-with-web-services" target="_blank">thanks to Max Slaybak for the original idea</a>)
  * {todo add source here}
  * Right-click the Project to display the properties and select the Web tab on the left
  * in the IIS section use IIS Express and copy the address provided (you will need this later when consuming the Web Service through an Ajax call)
  *
