I am honored to have been selected to speak at this event and am very much looking forward to it. I have never been to the East Iowa SQL Saturday but everyone I know who has, simply raves about the manner in which it is run.

I will be presenting <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=239&sessionid=15737" target="_blank">An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL</a>. If you would like to learn about one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server, I&#8217;ll be in Room 2520B starting at 4PM!

> **An Optimistic Approach: Snapshot Isolation in SQL**
> 
> Until 2005, SQL Server was a very pessimistic RDBMS. However with the introduction of the Read Committed Snapshot database option and the new Snapshot Isolation level, that is no longer the case. After a high level look at all SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control in SQL Server. We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate. Come learn how to put one of the more powerful, but least understood, aspects of SQL Server to work for you!

> **Session Level: Intermediate**

In addition to my session, take a moment and check out all of the other <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/239/schedule.aspx" target="_blank">great topics</a> being presented throughout the day. I am thrilled to see strong <a href="http://minnesota.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">PASSMN</a> contingent on the schedule!

East Iowa will be the last stop on my 2013 Upper Midwest SQL Saturday speaking tour. So far this year I have spoken in Minnesota, Madison, Chicago, Fargo, and now Iowa City. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of months, but an experience I would not trade for anything.

If you&#8217;re local, or in the surrounding area, I hope you&#8217;ll take advantage of this great free training opportunity! I hope to see you there!
