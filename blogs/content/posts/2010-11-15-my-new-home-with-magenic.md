excerpt: 'After this week comes to an end, I will be moving to the Magenic family.  I say family because over the months of talking to them I quickly realized that the group at Magenic truly is a family.  Not only one that holds themselves together with a high level of expertise but one that openly draws off each others knowledge and skills.'

The SQL Community is an important part to everything I do both in work and pleasure. Over the last year, I&#8217;ve started to realize that the work aspect to my life could be pushed higher and at the same time, pushed more into a role that benefits the SQL Community. It is always hard to disconnect yourself as a production DBA from the systems that you build and nurture from a failing service into an enterprise worthy service. Even so, I&#8217;ve made the decision to part with those systems and my current employer to move into a role that will for one, be more challenging and second, a company that supports both the community and has great pride in the product and services they provide.

After this week comes to an end, I will be moving to the [Magenic][1] family. I say family because over the months of talking to them I quickly realized that the group at Magenic truly is a family. Not only one that holds themselves together with a high level of expertise but one that openly draws off each others knowledge and skills. 

All job changes come with a certain amount of disconnect while the adjustments are made. I hope this change will be quick so I can keep to my goals of helping the community from the forum, blog and speaking side of things. I would like to thank everyone (and I mean everyone) in the community for the years of helping me push myself daily to be better. I owe this change to all of you as much as anyone.

I look forward to the future and sharing everything it has with the community.

Personal thanks go out to my future new coworkers Aaron Lowe and Wendy Patrick. I canâ€™t wait to get the SQL Saturday in Chicago crew back together now in roles where we can take over the data architecture world!
