The folks at http://sqlperspectives.wordpress.com are reviewing the SQL Server Deep Dives book a chapter at a time (one chapter per week). The review is usually done by more than one person, so far there are already 8 chapters reviewed. I think that this is a very cool idea, it is almost like a book club.

Since they reviewed my chapter about the _minimally logged bulk insert_, they asked me to do an interview. You can find that interview here: http://sqlperspectives.wordpress.com/2010/03/26/an-interview-with-denis-gobo/

You can also find the reviews by Richard Rodriguez, Chris Shaw and Jeremy Lowell here: http://sqlperspectives.wordpress.com/category/chapter-8/
