Time for another episode of the **SQL Friday, The Best SQL Server Links Of The Past Week** show.
  
Here is what I found interesting this past week in SQL Land:

**[Understanding backups and log-related Trace Flags in SQL Server 2000/2005 and 2008][1]**
  
Kimberly Tripp is giving a play by play from 2000 to 2005/2008 to discuss the differences and what's changed and why those changes were significant. The biggest changes were between 2000 and 2005.

**[Business Rule Enforcement][2]**
  
Louis Davidson explains how to enforce business rules and what the difficulty is

**[LINQ to SQL: The ongoing Developer/DBA debate][3]**
  
Jonathan Kehayias shows us what he thinks of LINQ to SQL

**[Who is Active? v7.30][4]**
  
Adam Machanic has released the latest version of his _Who is Active_ script. Who is Active? is a comprehensive DMV-based monitoring script, designed to tell you at a glance what processes are active on your SQL Server and what they're up to. It has a number of optional features so that you can get results quickly, or monitor deeply, depending on your needs when you happen to be using the script. 

**[Sp_indexinfo has been updated][5]**
  
Tibor Karaszi has updated his Sp_indexinfo procedure
  
This procedure will give you the following info:

  * What indexes exists for a particular table or for each table in the database
  * Clustered, non-clustered or heap
  * Columns in the index
  * Included columns in the index
  * Unique or nonunique
  * Number rows in the table
  * Space usage
  * How frequently the indexes has been used
  * Any obvious indexes I should add?

**[Digging Around in SQL Internals â€“ View Page Data][6]**
  
Michelle Ufford wrote a post about using DBCC Page and sys.system\_internals\_allocation_units to view page data

**[How to copy DTS 2000 packages between servers (and from SQL 2000 to SQL 2005 and SQL 2008)][7]**

The PSS SQL Server Engineers show us how to migrate SQL Server 2000 DTS packages to a SQL 2005 Server without upgrading them, thus leaving them as legacy DTS 2000 packages within SQL 2005

**[Estimated and Actual execution plan revisited][8]**
  
Gail Shaw explains why the terms 'estimated execution plan' and 'actual execution plan' are perhaps a little bit misleading.



That is it for this week, I will tag the weekly posts with **SQL Friday** in case you want to see the whole archive in the future
