There are five days left yet, but I can say now: 2010 has been the most extraordinary year of my life. 365 days ago, I could not have dreamed the places I would go, the adventures I would have, the things I would do, the races I would run, and, most of all, the people I would meet. I am amazed by how far I have come, and grateful to all the people that have helped me get here.

**One year ago:** I was &#8220;Decision Support Tech&#8221; at a small company, writing reports and monitoring six servers. I&#8217;d written a handful of blogs and attended a couple user group meetings. I had run two 5K races. I was just finishing my term as President of the Oshkosh Jaycees. I cooked and baked a lot.

**Today:** I am a Database Administrator at Kimberly Clark, working on hundreds of servers all over the world. I blog on my own site, I blog at LessThanDot.com, I have blogged for SQL University, I have not only attended but spoken at user groups and SQL Saturdays, and I am helping to lead the PASS WIT group. I have run almost 300 miles this year, including five 5Ks, a five-mile, and a 10K. For the Jaycees, I&#8217;ve chaired two events, including a first-year masquerade ball, collected school supplies, collected hats and mittens, and enjoyed every event. I am a much better cook and now I blog about that too.

A year can change so many things. For me, 2010 made me realize what I really love and want to focus on.

A year ago, I sat down and [wrote a few goals for myself][1]. I&#8217;ve been reviewing them every quarter. Here are my fourth quarter results.

**WI SSUG meetings:**
  
I attended the October meeting and listened to Ted Krueger ([Twitter][2] | [Blog][3]) speak. He gave an excellent presentation on query execution plans. Thanks Ted!

There was no meeting in November due to PASS Summit. In December, I didn&#8217;t attend because of the weather. Quite frankly, I&#8217;m very disappointed in the WI SSUG right now. I have to drive an hour and a half to make it to the meetings, and I&#8217;ve been weighing if it&#8217;s worth it for a few months. I&#8217;m hoping for positive changes in 2011.

**Blog Once a Week:**
  
Since October 1, I&#8217;ve posted 7 technical blogs. That&#8217;s not a lot. However, my main focus this quarter has been my new job. Moving to Kimberly Clark has been a huge change, with a tremendous amount to learn about their business, software, tools, and processes. I&#8217;ve also changed from working with, and thus writing primarily about, Reporting Services to being a production DBA, and am just beginning to shift my learning and writing focus.

The most exciting blogging news is that I have moved my tech blogs to this site, LessThanDot.com, and I&#8217;m really happy I&#8217;ve joined that community.

**Reading:**
  
I read a lot of blogs, and I grab books I need to reference. I am working through MCTS 70-432 Exam Microsoft SQL Server 2008 &#8211; Implementation and Maintenance , in preparation for taking the exam in January. I also got a wonderful Christmas present from my friend Aaron Nelson ([Twitter][4] | [Blog][5]), and will be tackling Windows PowerShell in Action over the next few weeks. (Thanks Aaron!) It&#8217;s a lot harder for me to read a tech book cover-to-cover than, say, the Neil Gaiman book currently sitting on my coffee table.

**Running:**
  
On 10/10/10, I ran my first 10K (6.2 miles). That was a great race, and I&#8217;m proud of myself for making that distance. I also ran the St. Joe&#8217;s 5K on 10/16, a 5 mile Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving, and the Race for the Light 5K on 12/4. That was a lot of running in 8 weeks! I set several personal bests during those races.

What&#8217;s amazing to me is that I ran 268.69 miles in 2010. Me, the girl who couldn&#8217;t run a quarter mile a year and a half ago. And I love it. I have good runs and bad runs and meh runs, but I love it. I have enjoyed sweating in the July heat, and sucking in the cold December air, and splashing through mud puddles in March, and crunching through leaf piles in October. I have big plans for my running shoes next year.

**Jaycees:**
  
It was a busy three months for the Oshkosh Jaycees. We held our first masquerade ball, Oshquerade, which I chaired. It was a great event and a great learning experience. I collected hats & mittens for our partner elementary school. I also went on a visit to the school with Santa to hand out Christmas cookies. My six-year term on board of directors has come to an end, and wow, has it has been an incredible journey.

**Cooking:**
  
I almost forgot that I set a goal to make what I thought was one of the most difficult things I would ever try: Hollandaise sauce. But I went for it on the morning of Christmas Eve, and it was delicious! It wasn&#8217;t as hard as I thought it would be. Just keep the heat low and stir, stir, stir. I think my favorite recipe from this year is either chicken marsala or savory popcorn.

2010 has been extraordinary. But the best part, hands down, has been the people I&#8217;ve met. Through Jaycee events, SQL events, running, and new coworkers, I&#8217;ve met a lot of amazing people.

I don&#8217;t know what 2011 has in store for me, but I can&#8217;t wait to find out.
