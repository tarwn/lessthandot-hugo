Looks very nice and clean, you can see how many followers you got and also how many people unfollowed you. The number of favorites, retweets and clicks is also available. If you have tweets that have a higher than usual reach it will be highlighted. The dashboard is realtime, if you tweet something it will be visible within a second or so

You can also see followers, here is what it looks like
