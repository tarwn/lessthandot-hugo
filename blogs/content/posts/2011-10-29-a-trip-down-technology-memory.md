This week I had training in a building on campus where I have never been before. The interesting part besides the training was that there was a mini museum in this building. There were a bunch of old and very old pieces of technology stored here. I had to laugh when I picked up a mobile phone from the early 80s, this thing weighed several pounds. Make sure to take a look at that 10 pound hard drive with all those 12 inch platter....or what about that PDP/11?.....good times....I don't even know what half of these things are.

The quality of the pics is so so, it was in a room without too much light and I took it with a BlackBerry...not the best camera around

Enjoy the pics...scroll down to the bottom, I also have a video now
