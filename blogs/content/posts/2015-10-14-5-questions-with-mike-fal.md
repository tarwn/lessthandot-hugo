Today, let me introduce you to Mike Fal (<a href="http://www.mikefal.net/" target="_blank">blog </a>| <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Fal" target="_blank">twitter </a>| <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/michael-fal/13/b70/b97" target="_blank">linkedin</a>). His blog header says a lot about him &#8211; it shows a pile of SQL books and a trombone &#8211; but it isn&#8217;t everything. First, it can&#8217;t show his sense of humor, or love of a good beer. Second, it doesn&#8217;t convey that he&#8217;s one of the smartest and most helpful PowerShell users I know. Mike even has <a href="https://github.com/mikefal" target="_blank">his own GitHub repository of helpful POSH scripts</a>!

Let&#8217;s chat with Mike&#8230;

### Mike, what&#8217;s your job title, and what does that mean? What do you _do_ every day?

I&#8217;m a &#8220;Senior SQL Server DBA&#8221; at Xero (<a href="http:://www.xero.com" target="_blank">http:://www.xero.com</a>), but it&#8217;s not really not an accurate description of what I do. Right now I&#8217;m more of an architect, helping design Xero&#8217;s SQL Server footprint for AWS. This involves a lot of design, planning, and research. I still get my hands dirty with tech because we use a lot of Powershell to manage and deploy the platform. However, because I&#8217;m still a DBA, I will get involved with troubleshooting things when they break.

### You&#8217;re a musician. Tell me a little about that &#8211; what you play, how long you&#8217;ve been playing, what groups you play with.

Ah, my &#8220;secret shame&#8221;. My college degree is Bachelor of Music Performance, Bass Trombone. (Yes, I got a B.M.) I&#8217;ve been playing now for about 25 years, starting in 7th grade and still going strong today. I currently play with two groups, Zing The Great Big Band (<a href="http://www.zingbigband.com/" target="_blank">http://www.zingbigband.com/</a>) and the Lakewood Symphony Orchestra (<a href="http://lakewoodsymphony.org/" target="_blank">http://lakewoodsymphony.org/</a>). Music is a vital part of my life. I love tech and it&#8217;s great for putting food on the table, but music feeds my soul.

There&#8217;s actually a lot of musicians in the tech world, especially in our community. What we do attracts musicians, because database work is very much an art form. The phrase &#8220;it depends&#8221; speaks to this, because while we have rules and best practices, we often have to craft a solution specific to our needs. With music, we play what&#8217;s written on the paper, but musicians will add and enhance that with their own style.

### PowerShell &#8211; you knew this one was going to come up! Why do you love it and advocate for it so much?

I, like many others, am lazy. I don&#8217;t want to get stuck doing tedious tasks and when I fix a problem, I want to fix it the first time. In IT, there&#8217;s a lot of work that&#8217;s repetitive. If something is repetitive, it can be automated. Enter Powershell. Many seasoned DBAs already have their library of SQL scripts for doing work and checking things, but that&#8217;s limited to a SQL Server. Powershell works outside the &#8220;stack&#8221;, letting us script and automate so much more and giving us a more graceful way to perform a lot of tasks. I don&#8217;t think \*everything\* should be done in Powershell, nor is it a replacement for SQL, but when you combine SQL and Powershell you can do some pretty cool things.

### You&#8217;re stranded on a desert island. What three books do you want with you?

This is Your Brain on Music <a href="//daniellevitin.com/publicpage/books/this-is-your-brain-on-music/" target="_blank">(http://daniellevitin.com/publicpage/books/this-is-your-brain-on-music/</a>) was an amazing read. If you&#8217;re curious about how music affects us and how we process it, you need to read this book.

The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide the Galaxy (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345391802" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345391802</a>) just fits me. I love the humor, I love the randomness, and I love how it turns your thinking a bit on its ear.

Dune (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert-ebook/dp/B00B7NPRY8" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert-ebook/dp/B00B7NPRY8</a>) is one of those few books I think everyone should read. This book is a ground breaking piece of science fiction, pushing the genre beyond where it was when the book was published. Plus, it&#8217;s really fun.

### Should I move to Colorado, and why?

Because it&#8217;s awesome! 300 days plus of sunshine is a great start, making it an outdoorsy kind of state. Lots of great hiking, biking, skiing, running, etc. For a big city, it also doesn&#8217;t feel that crowded. We&#8217;re pretty laid back out here and we LOVE good beer. Sure, it&#8217;s dry and we don&#8217;t have any major bodies of water, but I can live without that.

Well, what do you know&#8230;I have a tattoo inspired by Dune (the Litany Against Fear), and I definitely want to move to Colorado! Make sure you say hi to Mike when you see him at a user group, SQL Saturday, conference, or Zing The Great Big Band Performance!
