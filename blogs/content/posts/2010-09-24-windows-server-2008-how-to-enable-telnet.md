By default, Telnet is disabled on a Windows Server 2008 installation and if you try to run it you will see an error something along the lines of:

So, here's a very simple walk-through of the steps I had to follow in order to enable Telnet on a Windows Server 2008 box:

1. Open the Server Manager:

2. Select "Features" from the left TreeView pane and then click "Add Features" from the right-hand pane:

3. Select "Telnet Server" from the list of available features and click Next followed by Install:

4. Wait for what seems ages (it was probably only 5 minutes but it seemed like a long time!) whilst it installs the server:

5. When it is complete, open a command prompt, type "telnet" and you should be presented with the following screen:
