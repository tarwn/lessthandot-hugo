Here is your gift from Microsoft for the holidays: Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 Virtual Machines with Sample Data. Brian Keller writes

> Just in time for the holidays, we have posted a brand new virtual machine (VM) which is pre-configured with Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate Beta 2, Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2010 Beta 2, and sample data that you can use to help learn the product, perform demonstrations, etc. This VM included everything you need to learn and demonstrate the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) capabilities of Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 (with the exception of Lab Management). This VM is available in the virtualization platform of your choice (Hyper-V, Virtual PC 2007 SP1, and Windows [7] Virtual PC). Hyper-V is highly recommended because of the performance benefits and snapshotting capabilities.

There are also 7 hands-on labs available
