While reading [Microsoft SQL Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals][1], I decided I should always have a book with me to read, learn and understand more about the technoligies and environments I&#8217;m working in. So when I finished the book I didn&#8217;t had to look long. Since Jes is a co-blogger and I met Mladen Prajdic in person during the last Belgian SQL Server Days, I ordered [Pro SQL Server 2012 Practices][2].

**Chapter 1: Be Your Developer&#8217;s Best Friend By Jesper Johansen**
  
Quite a title for a DBA, huh. I guess it&#8217;s something like keep your friends close but your ennemies closer. But Jesper is right. How different the point of view to SQL Server may be for a DBA en a developper. They still have to work together on a daily basis to get a happy customer.
  
So Jesper shows how a DBA can get control over and confidence in the environment he&#8217;s responsible for and how he/she can give controlled admin rights to the developers in the company.
