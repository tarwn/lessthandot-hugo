Wow, it is an interesting day today, first we had Google: [Has Google Been Hacked? Every search result shows This site may harm your computer.][1]
  
Now if you visit the http://ma.gnolia.com/ site you are greeted with this message

> Dear Ma.gnolia Community Members or Visitor,
> 
> Early on the West-coast morning of Friday, January 30th, Ma.gnolia experienced every web service's worst nightmare: data corruption and loss. For Ma.gnolia, this means that the service is offline and members' bookmarks are unavailable, both through the website itself and the API. As I evaluate recovery options, I can't provide a certain timeline or prognosis as to to when or to what degree Ma.gnolia or your bookmarks will return; only that this process will take days, not hours.

What is going on here? Why don't they have redundancy? Something doesn't seem right here.
