**The Topic** 

[Microsoft SharePoint][3] is everywhere, in organizations of all sizes. If it is in yours, or your company is considering implementing it, you won't want to miss this. What is SharePoint? Itâ€™s a presentation and collaboration platform. Itâ€™s a document authoring and sharing tool. People can set up web sites with it, manage documents, and publish reports.

SharePoint is supported and used throughout the IT department. SharePoint administrators deploy and support it. SQL Server DBAs back up and safeguard the data. System administrators work to implement security. Service desk supports it. Developers create workflows and custom pages. Business intelligence analysts publish reports to it. Users throughout the company will be accessing, changing, and using the data in it. It is a company-wide software platform.

People in any role in IT will benefit from attending Tech on Tap v1.2!

**The Sessions** 

We have four fantastic speakers coming to teach us!

[Chuck Heinzelman][4] from Microsoft will be talking about SharePoint, SQL and Kerberos â€“ What Now?

[Rob Bogue][5] from Thor Projects LLC, and a Microsoft SharePoint MVP, will present Claiming to Get Forms-Based Authentication.

[Rick Fischer][6], a local presenter from Oracular, asks us Are You Drowning in a Sea of Data? InfoPath, SharePoint, and Workflows Can Help You Swim To Safety!

[David Peterson][7], from Trek Bicycle Corporation, will teach us about Demystifying PowerPivot from the SharePoint Adminâ€™s Perspective.

**The Beers** 

It wouldnâ€™t be Tech on Tap without microbrews on tap! Weâ€™ll be featuring [Stone Cellar Brewpubâ€™s][8] Marquette Pilsner, Pie Eyed India Pale Ale, and Stone Cellar Stout. The organizers have been taste-testing the beers to make sure we bring you the best. ðŸ˜‰
