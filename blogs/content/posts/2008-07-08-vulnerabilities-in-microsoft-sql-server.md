Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (941203)

This security update resolves four privately disclosed vulnerabilities. The more serious of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to run code and to take complete control of an affected system. An authenticated attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

This security update is rated Important for supported releases of SQL Server 7.0, SQL Server 2000, SQL Server 2005, Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (MSDE 2000), Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Desktop Engine (WMSDE), and Windows Internal Database (WYukon).
