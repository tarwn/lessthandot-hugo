# Frequently asked questions

**Do you need an internet connection?**

Yes. SQL Cop downloads an XML configuration file, this occurs during startup. After SQL Cop is loaded and you click on nodes, web pages are loaded to give you more detail about the check that was just run and how to eliminate the problem if you wish.

**What versions of SQL Server are supported?**

We tested with 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2008 R2.

**What versions of Windows are supported?**

The tool was tested on Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 (64 and 32 bit).
