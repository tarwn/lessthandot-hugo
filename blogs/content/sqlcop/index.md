# SQLCop

Welcome to the LessThanDot SQLCop website.

## Introduction

The purpose of SQL Cop is to highlight potential problems in your SQL Server database. [SQL Cop detects many different issues](detectedissues.php), some of which may not be a problem for you, and therefore can be ignored. However, it is recommended that you investigate each item displayed by SQL
Cop and carefully decide whether or not it should be corrected.

## SQL Test Integration

SQLCop tests can now be run from within SQL Server Management Studio with add-in named [SQL Test](http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-test/) available from [Red Gate Software](http://www.red-gate.com). SQL Test allows you to run the SQLCop tests, but also allows you to write and run unit tests for your TSQL code.
