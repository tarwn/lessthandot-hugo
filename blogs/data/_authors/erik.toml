bio = "Erik has been working in IT since 1993 and starting in 2004 has specialized in MS SQL Server query writing, database design, and reporting services. He also professionally does web site design/developing and writes C# applications (mostly for projects involving his databases and web sites). His career in the industry truly started when he first began using computers in the late 70s. In 1984 he began programming on the IBM PCJr, and performed game testing on King's Quest I. These early experiences gave him the taste and drive to continue an incremental and self-taught path all the way to his current position. Erik is also interested in taekwondo, go (ranks 4k on KGS), sci-fi books, mathematics, philosophy, religion, and rollerblading. He and his family live on the West Coast of the US."
