bio = "As a Senior Business Intelligence Consultant, Josh has been working with the Microsoft BI stack exclusively for the last 5 years. He has earned MCITP in both SQL 2005 and SQL 2008 versions of the tools. Numerous production implementations have been completed under his watch, including large healthcare providers, commercial real estate firms, and public libraries. Josh is also an active member of PASS, Chapter Leader of West MI SQL, and chair of SQL Saturday #160 -- Kalamazoo. When he's not building BI solutions, he enjoys spending time with his 6 year old son, slinging lead at the gun range, and exercising (but never in his underwear. Promise.)"
